Good food great Jazz. (Making a booking is absolutely necessary)<br><br><b>Author: </b>Levent Parman; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions.As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.
In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Cary Ota; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Good music, but be ready to pay for the rest.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Paul Painter; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Jazz Club with no Jazz.

The sandwiches (with the porchetta or the cutlet) are sold 4 euros each, price above the average of the sandwiches in Rome.
The porchetta sandwich (about 50 gr. Of product, do not be fooled by the measures of the schiacciatina and / or ciabattina) is easily between € 2.50 and € 3.00 with double the porchetta and served with the classic ciriola ( if you want to make the porchetta sandwich in Rome respect the tradition).
The sandwich with the cutlet (packaged product AIA style) and accompanied by a sad leaf of salad and this too is easily found between 3 euros and 3 euros and 50 (and also here cutlet that overflows from the sandwich as it is placed in the middle of the same ).
But at least a minimum of seasoning (mayonnaise, mustard, spicy sauce, etc.), I do not have to be the customer to ask you but you owner and / or manager and / or committed to propose it to me.
But, unfortunately, it is I who let myself be tempted unlike other cunning ones (and there are many considering that at 19.00 he had just beaten 4 receipts), not turning to better sandwich shops and / or shops.

I don't know if they also make aperitifs 🤔. It is in a fairly secluded and quiet spot

It is by reservation with the table. At the entrance there are the typical controls, temperature / mask obligation (entrance / s in the bathroom). If someone is new they make a 3 € club card, which lasts one year, you have to fill in a sheet with the data of some document eg. identity card etc.

At the entrance they do not charge but they are 15 € per person I think I understand abbiamo, we understood this at the end of the evening when they told us that the table must reach a certain amount based on the people present.

Nice place for groups and not, recently opened but should still ""evolve"" on a little something. It is a former house / villa, in fact it knows a bit of ""improvised"" from the standpoint of preparation. The typical cocktail bar atmosphere with soft lighting, not disco dark, the drinks not bad, there are no dance floors.

Music: beautiful, mix of American, reggaeton, Italian, usual commercial, the one that sometimes you hear on the fashion radio of the moment.

Target of people: very mixed, from 20 to 35 years more or less, let's say that everyone is going to his own business with his group

Location: medium-sized, neither large nor small, there are tables all over the ground floor, up the stairs, other tables in the garden, and others on the terrace where there is also the bar. What I didn't like is the bathroom ..., the main one is small, and it's ONE 😬😅, and it's not separate the male and female one 😐, so the row is what it is..🙄. But there are 2 other ""reserved"" bathrooms, in fact if the staff sees a lot of line they distribute the people in the other 2 which are just like those in a house, with the tub and all the accessories 😂. Only they have to pay more attention to the lack of toilet paper 🧐. I think they have to organize them better, since there are 3 in total and separate the male from the female 🙊🙌🏻<br><br><b>Author: </b>Andrea Bolognesi; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>6 months ago<br><br><br>",CLUB
