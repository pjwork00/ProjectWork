A true authentic Italian restaurant where the locals eat! So reasonably priced for the quality. My only issue which I feel I have to mention is that our waiter was not too inviting as we were tourists who didn't speak Italian, he practically chucked my meal on the table and I had to catch it üòÖ. I am not marking down the place for this issue as we feel it was just him personally as everyone else was very welcoming and other waiters were friendly and joking with their tables, even those tables with tourists.

It never happened in three years that a pub does not allow me to give to my son his own food. They have good food, but definitely (or at least in my humble caring-parent opinion) not suitable as main meal for a 3 yo kid. Maybe something has changed in the last months: they refused to swap chairs to make my kid more comfortable, they do not have seats for children and they do not allow parents to give their own food to children. As a sad end of the story, while we were going away saying we cannot stay in a place where they do not allow to feed our son, they just answered ""please go away, we have other customers waiting"".
My son, as soon as we were out, expressed his clear-as-only-a-child-can opinion: ""they were not friendly, daddy"".<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

I highly recommended this place.<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Sher Vasquez; Rating: 5; When: 8 months ago <br> Here's the thing.. I really don't even want to give Roscioli a rating... because I'm afraid it's already been discovered and I don't want to not be able to get a table next time I come to Rome (or let's get real, tomorrow when I go back for dinner again).

They are known for the cabonara, which is creamy perfection, but I cannot hold back my praises for the world's creamiest burrata and most mouth watering pasta: the cacio e pepe (which is four cheese & four peppers).  Oh my god.

The wine is great, the meats and cheeses are obviously fabulous (it's literally a stone cellar restaurant in the back of a butcher shop), but Jesus is that cacio e pepe pasta good.<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

Aside from the friendly waiter and the awesome pizzaiolo who came to check if we liked the pizza, the food itself is tasty. The homemade pasta has a great texture and the sauce is smooth and shiny, however the portion size is quite small, but that's a roman thing, apparently. The pizza was just great.

Although it is supposed to be a family run restaurant, we've booked in advance for late Saturday dinner (05 09 2020), the service from the waiter we received was cold, careless, reserved ""to those tourists"" - the waiter asked all Italian tables how was the food, offered deserts and more, with us it was just clearing the table. It'd be fine for all I care, besides, Amatrice pasta was nice and proper, hence two stars.

BUT

The Carbonara was bad, really screwed - dry, with eggs overcooked and stuck to pasta in tiny pieces. How can you make a carbonara that bad in Rome, in a family restaurant? How can you - a waiter not ask how is/was the food if you clearly see plate almost untouched? Ignorant, careless? We are not complainers, we noted these things to hostess, who was surprised, but then again - just for above mentioned reasons you might skip this place and write it off to the ""yet another overpriced tourist trap in Rome"" until proven wrong.<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Heeythere Rdgz; Rating: 5; When: 6 months ago <br> Home made food and an exellent service, congrats to the owners, the ma√Ætre who recommended us Carciofi alla Guidia (amazing dish), and the guy who served us, Stefano.

Be aware prices may change a bit for the same dish from time to time but it's a common practice among true Roman restaurants. It often depens on the waiter and it may be tricky on pizzas.

Still, it's by far the best one in the neighborhood.

Edit to answer the owner: Prices are clearly written on the menu.. given that it's provided. Which it's often not unless one specifically asks for it.

We did not realize that reservations were highly recommended, but we were able to be seated when we arrived. The staff was very kind and service was wonderful.

First of all there were flying insects everywhere. Probably they got inside the restaurant from the bathroom (As you can see in the photos). Secondly, the restaurant had a bad smell coming from the bathroom. Thirdly, it was cold inside.

The food had a good taste. The waiters were friendly.<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Mike G; Rating: 2; When: a year ago <br> Had a disappointing experience. The restaurant is located in a quiet and charming piazza so we thought we would give it a chance since it looked nice and was empty compared to the restaurant on the other side of the piazza. The atmosphere was nice, but the food was not particularly memorable. However, what really soured me on the entire experience was the reaction the staff had to their own mistake. We asked for still water, but they brought sparkling.  We told them we had asked for still and they acted annoyed but brought it. They never took away the glasses or the bottle of sparkling water.  Then when the check came there was a charge for the sparkling water.  We brought the charge to their attention, and again it was a big deal.  Even though half the bottle of sparkling water was still there (because another waiter had poured some of it into our glasses before we realized it wasn't still), they made a big deal that we had consumed it.  What were we supposed to do it with it, then?  This fuss was all over 3 Euros on a 90+ Euro tab! This wasn't even an issue of not wanting to pay for water - we just didn't want to pay for what we didn't order.  The owner/manager even came out to glare at us while talking with the waiter, as if we were supposed to feel guilty or something.   Really disappointing they would have such an attitude to customers over such a trivial amount that was their fault to begin with.   The final straw was the waiter asking how much of a tip we wanted to leave.  Whenever I am directly asked like that, I will always tip much less than I would have otherwise.  This was a disappointing end to a promising start.<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

We arrived in Italy to our apartment and the water on the entire building was out. After a 14 hour flight, all you want to do is take a shower and relax.

We chose this hotel due to the close proximity to our apartment rental, and was extremely impressed in all the offerings. The staff are very nice, extremely helpful, they accommodated our very short notice (ie.: walk in booking).

The hotel has character, it has a mix of historical vintage posh flair with modern amenities. The rooms are so bright and the ceilings very tall, and the decor matches to make the place look full of character.

The garden is beautiful in the centre, plus the bar and restaurant is amazing. This is as central as you can get to shopping (including high end shops) and a myriad of restaurants within a very short walking distance, including a small supermarket.

Definitely shall be recommending this to others and even consider just staying here rather than renting an apartment next time.<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

We traveled to Italy and visited Venice (baglioni Luna), Verona (due torri), Balogna (baglioni), and Tuscany (Castello del Nero) and then sadly this hotel in Rome. The shower/tub was unusable. I am thin 6' 145lbs and could barely fit in width. Height was fine. The tub did not drain, the faucet leaked all over my makeup bag. We blew a fuse with only the hairdryer plugged in...was told I used the wrong plug.

I was early for dinner for a variety of reasons, but the team here ushered me in - and apologized to me about the restaurants emptiness (but it was clearly my early arrival at fault).  Once seated, the waiter was kind enough to walk me through the menu and pointed to the dishes that he felt I needed to try.  They were happy to discuss in English, and I placed my order.

The dishes were well prepared, and are seafood focused, fresh from the Mediterranean.  They had a combination of sauces created that paired with each type of crustacean or fish, some sweeter, some  savoury.  The wine list was nice, and by the glass allowed wine pairings for the dishes..

Once I wrapped up, I was introduced to the owners, who were busily working to finish the preparations for the evening meals - they were pleasant and happy.  We shared a laugh, and it turned out a lovely meal.<br> NEXT <br> <br>"
