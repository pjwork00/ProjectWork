As a local tourist guide I tend to point out how the curious fountain, even in a rather conspicuous way, refers to the constant presence of the Pope in the Vatican, since the 13th century. Although, it is fair to say, the Fontana delle Tiare symbolizes the Borgo district, the one built close to the Vatican walls and, consequently, in constant and intimate relationship with the pontiff.
Excellent point, I still suggest, where to get fresh and healthy water on hot summer days.<br><br>",PRK

I like to cross Borgo, now more than ever, with the few tourists and the little bars at half service.
It is a different, less contemporary Rome, you can feel it.
Beyond Porta Castello there is the fountain, and it is useless to point out the pitiful state of abandonment in which it falls and the disheartening decay that reigns around it.
A pile of stacked stone balls, the head of a faun under a travertine arch and the worn coat of arms of the Municipality of Rome.
Perhaps it is a metaphor, the latest descent of the ""franzosi da 'sti laces"". Which made the dream of the Roman democrats vanish, putting ""er Papa Re"" on the throne.
This is also why there has always been a very heated rivalry between Italy and France.
‚ÄúEr comparison, it goes without saying, it doesn't hold up.

The fountain is in travertine the most representative stone of Rome, realized together with several others by Pietro Lombardi in the 20s of the last century (see the special note in the margin).

The working fountain with drinking water is framed by a round arch in travertine, crowned with bricks in whose apex is placed the emblem of the municipality of Rome, with the classic acronym (SPQR from the Latin Senatvs PopvlvsQve Romanvs - the Senate and Roman people).

Inside the niche formed by the aforementioned arch is the composition, at the center recessed in the fa√ßade there are nine balls in the first row and others placed behind the whole with a pyramid shape representing cannon balls of the nearby Castel Sant'Angelo, with the center a mask on whose mouth is inserted a cinnamon from which the water that spills onto a simple tank comes out, from which the water then pours onto a collection tray almost on the edge of the ground (the base of the fountain has a shape rounded and slightly raised).

The composition is completed by two hemispheres placed at the sides, from which water is poured through the spouts on as many small basins.

Overall, the fountain is pleasant and the state of conservation is discreet.

NOTE On the RIONI fountains:

They are very characteristic and are adorned with the emblem or the characteristic symbols of the district they represent were commissioned in 1926 by the governor of Rome, and the subsequent assignment was assigned to Pietro Lombardi, the architect who had already built the fountain of the Amphorae of Testaccio, he performed them in about three years.

They have been an important element since ancient Rome, today in addition to the typical cast-iron fountains called ""nasoni"" (around 2000), there are very beautiful ones located in the most disparate places, such as villas, squares, streets, courtyards and more.

An effort must be made to imagine the Leonine Walls untouched.
After the Saracens sacked St. Peter's Basilica, the wall protected the Vatican for a long time. It was Leo IV who took an interest in the work, completed in just four years.
Then, in a slow procession of people and dignitaries, he inaugurated them, covering the entire circuit barefoot, celebrating the rite of consecration.
Here, we are here after more than a millennium, in the exact point where the open diaphragm in the fortification that made Civitas inaccessible is evident, from the side of Porta Cavalleggeri.
Next to the walled entrance that bears the effigy of the Borgias, there is an elegant Roman sarcophagus that serves as a basin for a fountain that receives water from two side outlets. It is surmounted by a decorative element and two inscriptions, one dating back to Pius IV, the other to Clement XI.
It was once located near the circular tower, the guard post of the Pope's soldiers.
It was moved during the works for the construction of the PASA gallery.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Maximo04c; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>The fountain is well maintained and very beautiful to look at.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a month ago<br>The fountain in Porta Cavalleggeri, fully functional, is located in the XIII District (Aurelio), and its name refers to an ancient gate demolished in 1904 to enlarge Piazza del S. Uffizio, in some photos prior to that date it can be seen .

A walled reconstruction, even if in a different position from its original location, is placed near the fountain on its right.

The fountain of the sixteenth century, is located against the Vatican walls, near where the Porta Cavalleggeri was located and like many fountains in Rome it consists of a sarcophagus of ancient Rome, scrubbed and with ornaments on the sides, positioned on two supports in marble placed on a porphyry paving at ground level.

Two columns probably in red granite delimit the area of ‚Äã‚Äãrespect.

A lion's protome is placed in the upper part and symmetrically placed two circular tiles with outlets from which the water flows into the tub.

Above the composition are placed papal plaques and coats of arms.

The following inscription in Latin is placed on the first plate at the bottom:

PIVS IIII PONT. MAX.
VTILITATI PVBLICE ET
COMMODITATI EQVITVM
CVSTODIE PONT. AN.0
SAL. MDLXV

Remember that the construction of this fountain took place in 1565 by Pope Pius IV of the Medici (he was born in 1499, was elected in 1559 and died in 1565).

It is surmounted by the pope's coat of arms and on the sides it has two other coats of arms of which the one on the left is of the Municipality of Rome.

On the second top plate there is the following inscription in Latin:

AQVAM VTILITATI PVBLICAE

Yes, you read that right, it had a railway that connected the Kingdom of Italy with the Papal State. This railway was built in 1929 and worked for many years, for example in the post-war years it was used for the Pope's movements in and out of Rome.

This railway also holds a ""small record"" as it was the smallest railway in the world. Over the years it has been decommissioned and in 2000 (on the occasion of the Jubilee) one of the two tracks was removed to make room for what is now known as the Jasmine Walk.

As I wrote initially it is a little known place and if we want it also unusual and also the ways to reach it are unusual. In fact, you have to go to the Piazza della Stazione di San Pietro and enter, in fact, the Stazione di San Pietro.

Once inside, go right and continue along track 1 until you reach the entrance to the Jasmine promenade. It is a pedestrian path that connects the station of San Pietro with the Rampa Aurelia and has been defined as one of the romantic walks (besides that of the Janiculum) to do in Rome.

If you continue straight you will arrive at the entrance of the Vatican walls where the train once entered and exited, of course you cannot approach it but you can easily take a photo from behind the bars that divide the walk from the platform (now disused).

Once this fountain was located in Piazza Risorgimento and was in fact fed by the angelic water, then for the refurbishment of the Borgo district it was transferred to its current position.

The perfectly functioning fountain is located below street level and is reached via two small flights of curved and symmetrical staircases, creating a beautiful perspective view.

The small fountain is fairly simple, and is set against a brick face, with a curving marble crown.

The shape is that of the ancient aediculae of the Roman period, with two pilasters on the sides surmounted by a curved pediment, in whose tympanum there is an elaborate valve and in the upper part the inscription ""ACQUA ANGELICA"" is clearly visible and on the basis of the year of construction 1898.

In the central concave part there is the classic inscription that represents the municipality of Rome: S.P.Q.R. (from the Latin Senatvs PopvlvsQve Romanvs - the Senate and the Roman People).

Then a small and simple cinnamon stands out from which the water that flows onto a small basin comes out, with the protruding edge, but worn by time.

Everything is resting on a pavement of porphyry.

Moving them for traffic reasons was a widespread practice and via della Scrofa follows exactly the layout of an ancient Roman road and the fountain of the same name has not escaped the rule.
But the memory of it remains in a bas-relief left in its original position, along the facade of the building that was the convent of the Augustinians.
While not far away, right at the corner with via dei Portoghesi, there is now the small hanging tub with the superimposition of a simple cinnamon, from which a jet of fresh water comes out.
It is protected by three small columns connected to each other by two iron bars.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana della Scrofa (located in the street of the same name) is located in the VIII Eustachio district, once it was in the position, where today there is a bas-relief depicting a sow.

In the fifteenth century the bas-relief was walled up and at the end of the sixteenth century it was transformed into a fountain with the addition of a small basin.

In 1874 with Rome became the capital of Italy, the traffic in the area increased dramatically and therefore was a hindrance, so the bas-relief remained at its original point, while the fountain itself was moved a short distance to the corner of the street with Via dei Pellegrini .

The above is indicated in an inscription placed below the bas-relief:

The fountain then placed at the aforementioned corner is made up of a small nozzle, from which the water that flows onto the cup-shaped basin comes out, from which in turn the water arrives in a collection basin on the ground.

Before it was located near the Mausoleum of Augustus and for the works related to its isolation and the creation of Piazza Augusto Imperatore, it was dismantled and reassembled where we can now admire it.

The rectangular niche is surrounded by white marble, the fountain has, inside a shell, the head of a boy, with the cap of a porter, from whose mouth comes the water that spills onto a small semicircular basin, placed at top of the rocks,

This water in turn, through two spouts placed at the base of the tray, comes out on a rectangular basin supported by a barrel.

NOTE
Also at Largo San Rocco, a few meters from the fountain, there is another element that is worth seeing is a hydrometer, which as indicated in the inscription was inserted in 1821.

It served to measure the level of the Tiber floods, and by observing it better, one can see the inscriptions indicating the height reached by them in the sixteenth century: they are incredibly high.

FOUNTAINS NOTE IN ROME

The fountains in Rome, are one of the characteristic elements of the eternal city, there are those who say that it is the city with the most fountains in the world.
They have been an important element since ancient Rome, today in addition to the typical cast-iron fountains called ""nasoni"" (around 2000), there are some very beautiful ones located in the most different places, such as villas, squares, streets, courtyards and more.

Some have been created by the greatest artistic geniuses of all times, a name above all Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

The importance they have in street furniture is also demonstrated by the admiring looks of tourists and by the fact that they also have the social utility of quenching thirst after perhaps a long walk in the sun.<br><br><b>Author: </b>M.

History:

The fountains were built in 1957 and placed symmetrically against the marble fa√ßade of the two palaces.

Description of the work:

The fountain is made up of a crack placed on the wall of the building from which the water pours out onto a rectangular basin with a rounded and flared edge with the smaller dimension towards the bottom, which rests on two supports inserted in a large basin of mixtilinear shape placed on the ground to collect the water that comes out of the tank.

The area of ‚Äã‚Äãrespect is delimited by four columns, connected to each other by iron bars, which is very useful so as not to damage it and allow it to be viewed optimally.

NOTE on the conservation status of the work:

It is also quite good because it is a fairly modern artifact.

History:

The Fontanella is one of those created by Publio Morbiducci, winner of a competition promoted by the Governorate of Rome, in 1928, for the replacement of some cast iron fountains, with others of greater decoration.

It was made entirely of travertine, a stone that is the symbol of the city of Rome.

It was inaugurated on October 28, 1929.

Description of the Work:

The fountain is placed on a small rectangular porphyry rise, bordered by travertine which also determines an area of ‚Äã‚Äãrespect, has a particular predominantly triangular configuration, which rests on two cylinders placed at the sides, in the lower part and is surmounted by a hemisphere with four wedges

In the center there is an oval medallion, surmounted by a cardinal's hat and a cross and two bas-reliefs inside, the upper one representing a griffin symbol of the Parione district, in which there is the fountain and in the lower part a flower-shaped tile , in the center of which there is a curved cinnamon from which the water flows out and pours into a small rectangular basin, with the features of a small Roman sarcophagus, where on the front side on a scroll is the inscription SPQR

NOTE on the state of conservation of the work:

It is discreet even if it requires the removal of limestone encrustations and in my opinion a larger area of ‚Äã‚Äãrespect should be created, perhaps with columns joined by iron bars, to prevent the parking of cars or scooters less than one meter away.

The fountain was built in a later period, but always in the 16th century and is attributed to Nanni di Baccio Bigio, who did some restoration work on the palace.
