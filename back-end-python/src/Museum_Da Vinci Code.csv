There is something for everyone here, it ranges in different time periods and art forms. It surpasses anything we have in Canada in terms of an art museum.They have cute gift shops all around which is convenient.

The Mona Lisa may be on your bucket list, but please do yourself a favor and see the rest of the museum. There are many paintings that are breathtaking that do not get the attention because of the ""Photo Op"" paintings. Contrary to what I read, I did not have to wait in a long line. The Louvre is very easy to get to by Metro and easy to navigate. I'm American and it was my first time in Paris. I can't wait to visit again.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Priya Indian Vlogger in Germany; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>There is no doubt that it is an absolute must visit for anyone who visits Paris. The place is the most beautiful museum of the whole world and houses a great deal of artworks, paintings and monuments. It is a  real gem with lots of very high-end artworks. The quality of all sculptures is way too high as you can easily see and feel it. Mona Lisa is also in this museum. I was simply amazed at each and every part of this museum as it was full of history and has lots of very fine artworks around. It is very well organized and maintained and worth every penny. I would recommend to must visit it if you are going to Paris.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Marinko Zubac; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>The museum is amazing. We were the whole day in Louvre and still you have the impression that you could stay there forever. It's something you definitively should visit when in Paris.
Buy your tickets online so you don't have to wait in queues for the entrance.
The entrance to the museum is very simple. We waited for about 10 minutes to get through security. My suggestion is to get the Nintendo audio guide when visiting the Museum. It costs only 5 Eur and it helps a lot. The audio guide follows your location and helps to find around the museum. Its something like google maps for Louvre. When we were there Mona Lisa room was not too crowded so we had plenty of time to watch the painting. Do not search for souvenirs in the museum itself, you will have to go outside the museum in the direction of Metro station. There you will find the official Louvre Musem Shops.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Jenny Fall; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>3 weeks ago<br>Visiting the Louvre is an amazing experience that will stay with you forever. There is so much history and beauty to absorb and admire. The building itself is exquisite along with the beautiful painted ceilings. Then, there is of course all of the art. Winged Victory, Venus Di Milo, and the Mona Lisa are just a few of the world's most famous works of art that are permanently on display at the Louvre.<br><br>",MUSE
