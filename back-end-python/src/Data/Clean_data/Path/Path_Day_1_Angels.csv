I wanted to celebrate my birthday there.
My expectation was a good party with nice people.
Instead i got a club looking like a cellar full of people who only wanted to hear old italian pop.
Very loud music.
Ordering cocktails was a real torture. The bar was empty but the waitress was not interested in serving. She looked very arrogant and miserable. Barely she managed to mix two over expensive 'sex on the beach'. The glass was filled up with ice as much as possible and the rest of space with something that had a taste of bitter orange juice and cheap alcohol.
A terrible mix of something.
Best thing came as they closed the club very early and all the people had to wait for their jackets in a small room.
To keep it short: never ever EVER again. Waste of money and time.<br><br>",,TOUR
