I always keep an open mind when traveling abroad, and when staying in bigger cities I expect to pay more for a hotel room.  This hotel is definitely on the pricier side.  However, I wasn‚Äôt in Rome to hang out in a hotel room.  It was a place to sleep and served its purpose.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It‚Äôs around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn‚Äôt the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren‚Äôt the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL

The problem is the very poor descriptions on the exhibits and the lack of guided tours.

The exhibits are badly labelled with complicated, overly technical English , which assumes the  reader is already an expert in Roman history.  They don't have any guided tours, but obviously should.

Despite Covid, and very few visitors, the ticketing staff still manage to make you feel unwelcome. Also, at 15 euro per ticket,  this isn't a cheap experience.
