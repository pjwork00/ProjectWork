Not to mention the time we arrived in the room, with cigarette butts in the toilet and sheets and room stinking of cigarettes.

Not sure how it fits into a 3 star hotel.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Erin G; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Three stars based on convenience and location.  I always keep an open mind when traveling abroad, and when staying in bigger cities I expect to pay more for a hotel room.  This hotel is definitely on the pricier side.  However, I wasn‚Äôt in Rome to hang out in a hotel room.  It was a place to sleep and served its purpose.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It‚Äôs around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn‚Äôt the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren‚Äôt the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL

Emperor Trajan and his architect, Apollodorus of Damascus, built this visionary complex of 150 offices and shops in the early 2nd century AD. In their heyday, the markets sold everything from Middle Eastern silks and spices to fresh fish, fruit, and flowers.
Shops opened early and closed about noon. Almost all the shopping was done by men and the traders were almost exclusively male.
The Forum of Trajan (AD 107‚Äì13) was built in front of the market complex. It was a vast colonnaded open space with a huge basilica, and included two libraries. Dominating the ruins today is Trajan‚Äôs Column. Spiralling up its 98 ft (30 m) high stem are minutely detailed scenes depicting episodes from Trajan‚Äôs successful military campaigns in Dacia (present-day Romania)<br><br><b>Author: </b>Shelby Elkins; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>7 months ago<br>Highly recommend!

Trajan's Market (Latin: Mercatus Traiani, Italian: Mercati di Traiano) is a large complex of ruins in the city of Rome, Italy, located on the Via dei Fori Imperiali, at the opposite end to the Colosseum. The surviving buildings and structures, built as an integral part of Trajan's Forum and nestled against the excavated flank of the Quirinal Hill, present a living model of life in the Roman capital and a glimpse at the restoration in the city, which reveals new treasures and insights about Ancient Roman architecture.

Thought to be the world's oldest shopping mall, the arcades in Trajan's Market are now believed by many to be administrative offices for Emperor Trajan. The shops and apartments were built in a multi-level structure and it is still possible to visit several of the levels. Highlights include delicate marble floors and the remains of a library.

Construction

Trajan's Market was probably built in 100-110 AD by Apollodorus of Damascus,an architect who always followed Trajan in his adventures and to whom Trajan entrusted the planning of his Forum,[and inaugurated in 113 AD.During the Middle Ages the complex was transformed by adding floor levels, still visible today, and defensive elements such as the Torre delle Milizie, the ""militia tower"" built in 1200. A convent, which was built in this area in the 16th century was acquired by the state in 1885 and became the Goffredo Mameli barracks.This was demolished at the beginning of the twentieth century to restore Trajan's Markets to the city of Rome.

I always keep an open mind when traveling abroad, and when staying in bigger cities I expect to pay more for a hotel room.  This hotel is definitely on the pricier side.  However, I wasn‚Äôt in Rome to hang out in a hotel room.  It was a place to sleep and served its purpose.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It‚Äôs around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn‚Äôt the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren‚Äôt the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL
