We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn‚Äôt care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn‚Äôt see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that‚Äôs a normal thing. They didn‚Äôt even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn‚Äôt bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.
