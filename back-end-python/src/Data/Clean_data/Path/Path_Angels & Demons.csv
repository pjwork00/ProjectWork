We received a room upgrade upon arrival, which was a nice gesture. If possible get a room with balcony as you can see the Dome from there. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the room was spacious and well-equipped as compared to other Rome hotels we have visited.  The hotel's staff was courteous and welcoming (apart for some of the waitresses at the restaurant, who were not very attentive - e.g. they would not ask if you need anything like espresso). The hotel is in a very convenient and quiet location. One thing that could be improved is the breakfast - while the variety was satisfactory, it was one and the same each morning. The New Year's buffet dinner was a bit of a disappointment - the mood was not particularly festive and it closed before the start of the new year. Food was also a bit on the bland side.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Bob P.; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great location near everything! Friendly staff with good english. That's important to me since I'm totally ignorant of other languages. I might have been "" put on the elevator"" a bit due to a ""reservation foul-up"" that wouldn't make the room price I had reserved available for 2 days. They gave me an ""upgraded"" room for the first 2 days for the original price but said I would either have to move to the cheaper room after that or pay the upgraded price to stay in the original room. I decided to stay put. Who wants to pack up and move? Long story short it might have been a simple bait and switch type of thing, but I'm not sure. Oh, the room is nice but I don't know what the ""upgrade might be"".

Very clean and spacious, although I think we had one of the better rooms. Bathroom was great. We had a balcony in the room and a balcony in the bathroom. We did some sink laundry and let it dry in the balcony. This was our plan so we wouldn't have to pack as much clothing.

It was easy to catch an uber or taco from this hotel. Walking distance to the subway which was easy to use. We were able to travel to many destinations by walking it taking the subway. I recommend getting a subway ticket that includes unlimited rides for x amount of time. I think we did 48 hours.

Breakfast had many options and was very good. While Rome itself was very dirty with trash pretty much all over this hotel was very clean inside and out. I would definitely return to this hotel.<br><br>",,HOTEL

History:

The fountain was built in a later period, but always in the 16th century and is attributed to Nanni di Baccio Bigio, who did some restoration work on the palace.

Description of the work:

The non-functioning fountain (mute) is quite graceful inside a niche, decorated with a valve there is a Putto embracing the tails of two dolphins in the shape of volutes under him, who have their mouths open, from which a time the water poured out on a pan.

Two niches frame the niche, adorned with bas-reliefs depicting masks and which have human figures as capitals which are surmounted by a broken lintel above which has two stars on the sides with eight points on the sides, probably heraldic symbols.

NOTE on the conservation status of the work:

It is not in good condition and a restoration activity is required that would require the integration of the deficiencies and a cleaning of the incrustations.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Paolo Emilio Capaldi; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 years ago<br>Pretty fountain in Via Giulia, leaning against the left corner of Palazzo Sacchetti, corner via the mullet.

The church was designed by Giacomo della Porta and built by Domenico Fontana between 1518 and 1589, and completed through the personal intervention of Catherine de' Medici, who donated to it some property in the area.

I would have paid to watch the spectacle of the carriages, wagons and carts passing through the old narrow streets without pavement of vanished Rome.
As their number increased dramatically, many of the fountains the city had equipped itself with, which reduced the carriageway, began to create problems.
Moving them for traffic reasons was a widespread practice and via della Scrofa follows exactly the layout of an ancient Roman road and the fountain of the same name has not escaped the rule.
But the memory of it remains in a bas-relief left in its original position, along the facade of the building that was the convent of the Augustinians.
While not far away, right at the corner with via dei Portoghesi, there is now the small hanging tub with the superimposition of a simple cinnamon, from which a jet of fresh water comes out.
It is protected by three small columns connected to each other by two iron bars.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana della Scrofa (located in the street of the same name) is located in the VIII Eustachio district, once it was in the position, where today there is a bas-relief depicting a sow.

In the fifteenth century the bas-relief was walled up and at the end of the sixteenth century it was transformed into a fountain with the addition of a small basin.

In 1874 with Rome became the capital of Italy, the traffic in the area increased dramatically and therefore was a hindrance, so the bas-relief remained at its original point, while the fountain itself was moved a short distance to the corner of the street with Via dei Pellegrini .

The above is indicated in an inscription placed below the bas-relief:

IT WAS PLACED

MOVED TO THE CORNER OF THE VIA DEI PORTOGHESI
IN THE YEAR 1874

The fountain then placed at the aforementioned corner is made up of a small nozzle, from which the water that flows onto the cup-shaped basin comes out, from which in turn the water arrives in a collection basin on the ground.

Every time I try the history books, I rub my eyes to reread the events of this city.
In Piazza Nicosia, suffocated by parked cars, there is the beautiful fountain designed by Giacomo Della Porta.
Not just any one, because in Rome there are many works that bear his signature. But this one is not like the others and it was not as we see it today, because it was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, long before Valadier dedicated himself to it heart and soul with his genius.
What we see remains: the elevated octagonal basin, the elegant balustrade in cipollino marble and a basin decorated with heraldic emblems.
Only three small columns connected by two iron bars protect it from modernity.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Maria Tanasa; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>The fountain in Piazza Nicosia was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, was built in 1572 by Giacomo della Porta for Pope Gregory XIII Boncompagni, whose dragon we note on the basin, to inaugurate the restoration of the Virgin Aqueduct.
When Giuseppe Valadier carried out the current restyling of the Piazza del Popolo in 1823, it was demolished to be relocated to Piazza Nicosia in 1950, when renovation work was carried out on the area coordinated by the architect Marcello Piacentini.<br><br><b>Author: </b>vincenzo marsella; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 months ago<br>Beautiful fountain<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana del Trullo was designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1572.

Today it is located in Piazza Nicosia, it was placed here in 1950 (after having been dismantled for several years in the warehouses of the municipality).

Very beautiful is the octagonal basin, raised by two steps of the same shape, is the only original part left, the rest are reconstructions.

Fortunately it is protected by an area of ​​respect delimited by columns, connected with iron bars.

Unfortunately, the vehicles parked around and the small size of the Piazza, do not give the right emphasis to the work.<br><br>",,PRK

Good food great Jazz. (Making a booking is absolutely necessary)<br><br><b>Author: </b>Levent Parman; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions.As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.
In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Cary Ota; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Good music, but be ready to pay for the rest.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Paul Painter; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Jazz Club with no Jazz.

It was founded in Rome in 1603 by Federico Cesi, Francesco Stelluti, Anastasio De Filiis and Johannes van Heeck, in order to establish a meeting place for the development of the sciences. Its name refers to the sharpness that must have the sight of those who dedicate themselves to the sciences, to the future and to human progress, a property that characterizes the lynx, in relation to sight.
The Accademia dei Lincei has undergone many changes over time. After a first period of great prestige, due to the work of Cesi and the other founders and to the presence of partners such as Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Battista Della Porta, after Cesi's death in 1630, the Academy reduced its activities to almost to disappear. Only in 1847 there was a real resumption of its activities by Pope Pius IX who re-founded it in the Pontifical Academy of the Nuovi Lincei, which still exists today.
Subsequently from 1936 with the name of Pontifical Academy of Sciences.
Since 1986 the Accademia dei Lincei has been governed by a Statute which provides for it to be composed of 540 academics, divided according to three qualifications. Therefore 180 are the ""national"" ordinary members, 180 the ""foreign"" ordinary members and 180 are the ""corresponding"" members. All members are then divided into two classes: the first is that of Physical Sciences, while the second is that of Moral Sciences. Since 2001 the Physical Sciences Class is divided into 5 categories, while the Moral Sciences Class is divided into 7 categories.
The academy is located in the Villa Farnesina, in Rome; it was built between 1506 and 1512 by the young Peruzzi for the very wealthy Sienese banker Agostino Chigi, a great patron and prominent figure in early 16th century Rome, who had amassed a large fortune from the proceeds of the sale of the Tolfa alum and who enjoyed the protection of Pope Julius II first, and then Leo X. The Farnesina, which at the time was simply called Villa Chigi, was the first suburban noble villa in Rome and had a great prominence from the beginning, soon being cited and imitated. The architectural interventions, although they could be considered completed in 1512, continued for other works until 1520.
With the death of Chigi, in 1520, the villa declined and was depleted of furnishings and works of art. In 1580 it was purchased by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and thus had its current name. An unrealized project dates back to this period to connect Palazzo Farnese with the Farnesina with a covered passage. In 1714 it became the property of the Bourbons of Naples and in 1864 the ambassador Bermudez de Castro settled there, who, two years later, promoted a series of heavy restorations.
In 1884 the opening of the Lungotevere involved the destruction of a part of the gardens and of the loggia on the river, which perhaps had been designed by Raphael. As already mentioned, it has belonged to the Italian State since 1927, which had it restored in 1929 -1942 to be assigned to the Academy of Italy and on several occasions in 1969-1983.
Today it is used by the Accademia dei Lincei as a representative office and houses, on the first floor, the national print cabinet.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Silvia La morgia; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>Unfortunately it is only for work that I go there.

History:

The Fontanella is one of those created by Publio Morbiducci, winner of a competition promoted by the Governorate of Rome, in 1928, for the replacement of some cast iron fountains, with others of greater decoration.

It was made entirely of travertine, a stone that is the symbol of the city of Rome.

It was inaugurated on October 28, 1929.

Description of the Work:

The fountain is placed on a small rectangular porphyry rise, bordered by travertine which also determines an area of ​​respect, has a particular predominantly triangular configuration, which rests on two cylinders placed at the sides, in the lower part and is surmounted by a hemisphere with four wedges

In the center there is an oval medallion, surmounted by a cardinal's hat and a cross and two bas-reliefs inside, the upper one representing a griffin symbol of the Parione district, in which there is the fountain and in the lower part a flower-shaped tile , in the center of which there is a curved cinnamon from which the water flows out and pours into a small rectangular basin, with the features of a small Roman sarcophagus, where on the front side on a scroll is the inscription SPQR

NOTE on the state of conservation of the work:

It is discreet even if it requires the removal of limestone encrustations and in my opinion a larger area of ​​respect should be created, perhaps with columns joined by iron bars, to prevent the parking of cars or scooters less than one meter away.

NOTE FOUNTAINS IN ROME

The fountains in Rome are one of the characteristic elements of the Eternal City, some say it is the city with the most fountains in the world.

They have been an important element since ancient Rome, today in addition to the typical cast iron fountains called ""nasoni"" (around 2000), there are very beautiful ones located in the most diverse places, such as villas, squares, streets, courtyards and more.

Some were made by the greatest artistic geniuses of all time, one name above all Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

The importance they have in street furniture is also evidenced by the admiring glances of tourists and by the fact that they also have the social utility of quenching thirst after perhaps a long walk in the sun.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Mario D; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>3 years ago<br>Not very large rectangular fountain, it looks like a drinking trough for horses.

We received a room upgrade upon arrival, which was a nice gesture. If possible get a room with balcony as you can see the Dome from there. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the room was spacious and well-equipped as compared to other Rome hotels we have visited.  The hotel's staff was courteous and welcoming (apart for some of the waitresses at the restaurant, who were not very attentive - e.g. they would not ask if you need anything like espresso). The hotel is in a very convenient and quiet location. One thing that could be improved is the breakfast - while the variety was satisfactory, it was one and the same each morning. The New Year's buffet dinner was a bit of a disappointment - the mood was not particularly festive and it closed before the start of the new year. Food was also a bit on the bland side.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Bob P.; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great location near everything! Friendly staff with good english. That's important to me since I'm totally ignorant of other languages. I might have been "" put on the elevator"" a bit due to a ""reservation foul-up"" that wouldn't make the room price I had reserved available for 2 days. They gave me an ""upgraded"" room for the first 2 days for the original price but said I would either have to move to the cheaper room after that or pay the upgraded price to stay in the original room. I decided to stay put. Who wants to pack up and move? Long story short it might have been a simple bait and switch type of thing, but I'm not sure. Oh, the room is nice but I don't know what the ""upgrade might be"". Recommend none the less.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Kate Heltemes; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>This was our favorite hotel of our European vacation. Very clean and spacious, although I think we had one of the better rooms. Bathroom was great. We had a balcony in the room and a balcony in the bathroom. We did some sink laundry and let it dry in the balcony. This was our plan so we wouldn't have to pack as much clothing.

It was easy to catch an uber or taco from this hotel. Walking distance to the subway which was easy to use. We were able to travel to many destinations by walking it taking the subway. I recommend getting a subway ticket that includes unlimited rides for x amount of time. I think we did 48 hours.

Breakfast had many options and was very good. While Rome itself was very dirty with trash pretty much all over this hotel was very clean inside and out. I would definitely return to this hotel.<br><br>",,HOTEL
