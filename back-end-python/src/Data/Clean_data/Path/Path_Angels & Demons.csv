At Spanish Steps is always a good atmosphere, always with lots of cheerful young people.
Above Spanish Steps is the beautiful church of Trinit√† dei Monti. In front of the church is the obelisk in the glory of the Immaculate Conception which was created as a compromise between the Papal States and France,who wanted to erect a monument to King Louis XIV.
Also interesting is the Fontana della Barcaccia, was made in memory of a flood of the Tiber in the late 16th century, when at that place, after the withdrawal of water, remained stranded boat.
