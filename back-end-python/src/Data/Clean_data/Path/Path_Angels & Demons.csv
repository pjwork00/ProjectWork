I almost want to rate it 5 stars, but it was not perfect.  First, the service staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  In this hotel, the elevator is extremely small, a common hotel feature throughout Europe, so I got worried because my family brought a lot of luggage.  Yet, I think the staff is aware of this, so they offer to bring your luggage to your room, which created a good, initial impression on me.  In addition to the staff, I  liked the room my family got.  The room was very clean and modern-looking; furthermore, it also came with a nice, spacious patio!  After seeing my room, I still could not believe I was in a best western hotel.  The only reason why I can't give this hotel 5 stars is the room tends to get hot very easily.  The room has AC, but it is very weak.  Besides a few problems, I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Rome!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Sandy Kelver; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>We stayed 4 nights at this Best Western Plus hotel in Rome.  All the staff are friendly, helpful and make you feel welcomed from the minute you walk in the front door.  Rooms are a good size and very clean.  Bedding and towels are a nice quality.  The hotel is located within a 5 minute walk from the subway station and Vatican museum.  The bar and restaurant, located inside the hotel, offers a small menu but the variety of food offered is likely to appeal to most everyone.  The food is yummy!  If we were to return to Rome we would definitely stay here.<br><br>",,HOTEL

Good food great Jazz. (Making a booking is absolutely necessary)<br><br><b>Author: </b>Levent Parman; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions.As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.
In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Cary Ota; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Good music, but be ready to pay for the rest.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Paul Painter; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Jazz Club with no Jazz.

The location is superb, especially if you have tickets to the Vatican Museum which is just around the corner. Shops, metro, etc. all within walking distance, major downtown sights about 20 minutes by public transport. The room was impressive, comfortable, well air conditioned. Breakfast seemed a bit chaotic at first, but was eventually handled really well with the possibility for open air seating.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Islam Faress; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>Terrible Experience.

Extremely noisy rooms and 45 minutes waiting in the queue for breakfast!!

The WiFi signal is non-existent. The water in the shower in annoyingly weak!

It doesn't look anything like a 2 star hotel even.<br><br><b>Author: </b>David Connell; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great staff.  Very helpful.  Extremely professional.   Room spotless.  3 minutes from Cipro Metro Station and the same from Vatican Museum entrance .  I would highly recommend.   Breakfast is free and great choice.<br><br><b>Author: </b>ElysonGavin Lebig; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Overall, my experience with this hotel was fantastic! I almost want to rate it 5 stars, but it was not perfect.  First, the service staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  In this hotel, the elevator is extremely small, a common hotel feature throughout Europe, so I got worried because my family brought a lot of luggage.  Yet, I think the staff is aware of this, so they offer to bring your luggage to your room, which created a good, initial impression on me.  In addition to the staff, I  liked the room my family got.  The room was very clean and modern-looking; furthermore, it also came with a nice, spacious patio!  After seeing my room, I still could not believe I was in a best western hotel.  The only reason why I can't give this hotel 5 stars is the room tends to get hot very easily.  The room has AC, but it is very weak.  Besides a few problems, I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Rome!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Sandy Kelver; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>We stayed 4 nights at this Best Western Plus hotel in Rome.  All the staff are friendly, helpful and make you feel welcomed from the minute you walk in the front door.  Rooms are a good size and very clean.  Bedding and towels are a nice quality.  The hotel is located within a 5 minute walk from the subway station and Vatican museum.  The bar and restaurant, located inside the hotel, offers a small menu but the variety of food offered is likely to appeal to most everyone.  The food is yummy!  If we were to return to Rome we would definitely stay here.<br><br>",,HOTEL
