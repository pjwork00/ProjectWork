I almost want to rate it 5 stars, but it was not perfect.  First, the service staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  In this hotel, the elevator is extremely small, a common hotel feature throughout Europe, so I got worried because my family brought a lot of luggage.  Yet, I think the staff is aware of this, so they offer to bring your luggage to your room, which created a good, initial impression on me.  In addition to the staff, I  liked the room my family got.  The room was very clean and modern-looking; furthermore, it also came with a nice, spacious patio!  After seeing my room, I still could not believe I was in a best western hotel.  The only reason why I can't give this hotel 5 stars is the room tends to get hot very easily.  The room has AC, but it is very weak.  Besides a few problems, I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Rome!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Sandy Kelver; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>We stayed 4 nights at this Best Western Plus hotel in Rome.  All the staff are friendly, helpful and make you feel welcomed from the minute you walk in the front door.  Rooms are a good size and very clean.  Bedding and towels are a nice quality.  The hotel is located within a 5 minute walk from the subway station and Vatican museum.  The bar and restaurant, located inside the hotel, offers a small menu but the variety of food offered is likely to appeal to most everyone.  The food is yummy!  If we were to return to Rome we would definitely stay here.<br><br>",,HOTEL

It was founded in Rome in 1603 by Federico Cesi, Francesco Stelluti, Anastasio De Filiis and Johannes van Heeck, in order to establish a meeting place for the development of the sciences. Its name refers to the sharpness that must have the sight of those who dedicate themselves to the sciences, to the future and to human progress, a property that characterizes the lynx, in relation to sight.
The Accademia dei Lincei has undergone many changes over time. After a first period of great prestige, due to the work of Cesi and the other founders and to the presence of partners such as Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Battista Della Porta, after Cesi's death in 1630, the Academy reduced its activities to almost to disappear. Only in 1847 there was a real resumption of its activities by Pope Pius IX who re-founded it in the Pontifical Academy of the Nuovi Lincei, which still exists today.
Subsequently from 1936 with the name of Pontifical Academy of Sciences.
Since 1986 the Accademia dei Lincei has been governed by a Statute which provides for it to be composed of 540 academics, divided according to three qualifications. Therefore 180 are the ""national"" ordinary members, 180 the ""foreign"" ordinary members and 180 are the ""corresponding"" members. All members are then divided into two classes: the first is that of Physical Sciences, while the second is that of Moral Sciences. Since 2001 the Physical Sciences Class is divided into 5 categories, while the Moral Sciences Class is divided into 7 categories.
The academy is located in the Villa Farnesina, in Rome; it was built between 1506 and 1512 by the young Peruzzi for the very wealthy Sienese banker Agostino Chigi, a great patron and prominent figure in early 16th century Rome, who had amassed a large fortune from the proceeds of the sale of the Tolfa alum and who enjoyed the protection of Pope Julius II first, and then Leo X. The Farnesina, which at the time was simply called Villa Chigi, was the first suburban noble villa in Rome and had a great prominence from the beginning, soon being cited and imitated. The architectural interventions, although they could be considered completed in 1512, continued for other works until 1520.
With the death of Chigi, in 1520, the villa declined and was depleted of furnishings and works of art. In 1580 it was purchased by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and thus had its current name. An unrealized project dates back to this period to connect Palazzo Farnese with the Farnesina with a covered passage. In 1714 it became the property of the Bourbons of Naples and in 1864 the ambassador Bermudez de Castro settled there, who, two years later, promoted a series of heavy restorations.
In 1884 the opening of the Lungotevere involved the destruction of a part of the gardens and of the loggia on the river, which perhaps had been designed by Raphael. As already mentioned, it has belonged to the Italian State since 1927, which had it restored in 1929 -1942 to be assigned to the Academy of Italy and on several occasions in 1969-1983.
Today it is used by the Accademia dei Lincei as a representative office and houses, on the first floor, the national print cabinet.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Silvia La morgia; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>Unfortunately it is only for work that I go there.

The location is superb, especially if you have tickets to the Vatican Museum which is just around the corner. Shops, metro, etc. all within walking distance, major downtown sights about 20 minutes by public transport. The room was impressive, comfortable, well air conditioned.

Extremely noisy rooms and 45 minutes waiting in the queue for breakfast!!

The WiFi signal is non-existent. The water in the shower in annoyingly weak!

It doesn't look anything like a 2 star hotel even.<br><br><b>Author: </b>David Connell; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great staff.  Very helpful.  Extremely professional.

Breakfast is free and great choice.<br><br><b>Author: </b>ElysonGavin Lebig; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Overall, my experience with this hotel was fantastic! I almost want to rate it 5 stars, but it was not perfect.  First, the service staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  In this hotel, the elevator is extremely small, a common hotel feature throughout Europe, so I got worried because my family brought a lot of luggage.  Yet, I think the staff is aware of this, so they offer to bring your luggage to your room, which created a good, initial impression on me.  In addition to the staff, I  liked the room my family got.  The room was very clean and modern-looking; furthermore, it also came with a nice, spacious patio!  After seeing my room, I still could not believe I was in a best western hotel.  The only reason why I can't give this hotel 5 stars is the room tends to get hot very easily.  The room has AC, but it is very weak.  Besides a few problems, I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Rome!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Sandy Kelver; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>We stayed 4 nights at this Best Western Plus hotel in Rome.  All the staff are friendly, helpful and make you feel welcomed from the minute you walk in the front door.  Rooms are a good size and very clean.  Bedding and towels are a nice quality.  The hotel is located within a 5 minute walk from the subway station and Vatican museum.  The bar and restaurant, located inside the hotel, offers a small menu but the variety of food offered is likely to appeal to most everyone.  The food is yummy!  If we were to return to Rome we would definitely stay here.<br><br>",,HOTEL
