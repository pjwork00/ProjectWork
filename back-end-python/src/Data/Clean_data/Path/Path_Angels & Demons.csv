We stayed here for 3 nights and had no problems, our room was cleaned every day, the breakfast was fresh and plentiful (not a lot of different things but enough for every taste) and the staff was very polite (from the reception to the cleaning and the kitchen).

I definitely don't recommend it. I think they disregard the whole because they are in a good location. Not to mention the time we arrived in the room, with cigarette butts in the toilet and sheets and room stinking of cigarettes. We just didn't change hotels because it was time to go back to our country. Not sure how it fits into a 3 star hotel.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Erin G; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Three stars based on convenience and location.  I always keep an open mind when traveling abroad, and when staying in bigger cities I expect to pay more for a hotel room.  This hotel is definitely on the pricier side.  However, I wasn‚Äôt in Rome to hang out in a hotel room.  It was a place to sleep and served its purpose.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It‚Äôs around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn‚Äôt the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren‚Äôt the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL

I wanted to celebrate my birthday there.
My expectation was a good party with nice people.
Instead i got a club looking like a cellar full of people who only wanted to hear old italian pop.
Very loud music.
Ordering cocktails was a real torture. The bar was empty but the waitress was not interested in serving. She looked very arrogant and miserable. Barely she managed to mix two over expensive 'sex on the beach'. The glass was filled up with ice as much as possible and the rest of space with something that had a taste of bitter orange juice and cheap alcohol.
A terrible mix of something.

Once home to the city‚Äôs poor, the neighborhood has witnessed a proliferation of fashionable clubs, restaurants, and boutiques.
At the heart of this charming quarter, overlooking an attractive traffic-free square, stands the Basilica of Santa Maria ‚Äì probably the first official place of Christian worship in Rome. It was founded by Pope Callixtus I in the 3rd century, when Christianity was still a minority cult. According to legend, the church was built on the site where a fountain of oil had sprung up miraculously on the day that Christ was born.
The basilica became the focus of devotion to the Virgin Mary and today is famous for its splendid mosaics. Both the Madonna and Christ are among the figures depicted in the facade mosaics (c. 12th century), while in the apse is a stylized 12th-century mosaic portraying the Coronation of the Virgin. Below it are a series of realistic mosaic scenes from the life of Mary by the 13th-century Roman artist Pietro Cavallini. The oldest image of the Virgin is a 7th-century icon, which depicts her as a Byzantine empress flanked by a guard of angels. Another image of the Virgin and Child can be seen near the top of the campanile<br><br>",,TOUR

It was founded in Rome in 1603 by Federico Cesi, Francesco Stelluti, Anastasio De Filiis and Johannes van Heeck, in order to establish a meeting place for the development of the sciences. Its name refers to the sharpness that must have the sight of those who dedicate themselves to the sciences, to the future and to human progress, a property that characterizes the lynx, in relation to sight.
The Accademia dei Lincei has undergone many changes over time. After a first period of great prestige, due to the work of Cesi and the other founders and to the presence of partners such as Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Battista Della Porta, after Cesi's death in 1630, the Academy reduced its activities to almost to disappear. Only in 1847 there was a real resumption of its activities by Pope Pius IX who re-founded it in the Pontifical Academy of the Nuovi Lincei, which still exists today.
Subsequently from 1936 with the name of Pontifical Academy of Sciences.
Since 1986 the Accademia dei Lincei has been governed by a Statute which provides for it to be composed of 540 academics, divided according to three qualifications. Therefore 180 are the ""national"" ordinary members, 180 the ""foreign"" ordinary members and 180 are the ""corresponding"" members. All members are then divided into two classes: the first is that of Physical Sciences, while the second is that of Moral Sciences. Since 2001 the Physical Sciences Class is divided into 5 categories, while the Moral Sciences Class is divided into 7 categories.
The academy is located in the Villa Farnesina, in Rome; it was built between 1506 and 1512 by the young Peruzzi for the very wealthy Sienese banker Agostino Chigi, a great patron and prominent figure in early 16th century Rome, who had amassed a large fortune from the proceeds of the sale of the Tolfa alum and who enjoyed the protection of Pope Julius II first, and then Leo X. The Farnesina, which at the time was simply called Villa Chigi, was the first suburban noble villa in Rome and had a great prominence from the beginning, soon being cited and imitated. The architectural interventions, although they could be considered completed in 1512, continued for other works until 1520.
With the death of Chigi, in 1520, the villa declined and was depleted of furnishings and works of art. In 1580 it was purchased by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and thus had its current name. An unrealized project dates back to this period to connect Palazzo Farnese with the Farnesina with a covered passage. In 1714 it became the property of the Bourbons of Naples and in 1864 the ambassador Bermudez de Castro settled there, who, two years later, promoted a series of heavy restorations.
In 1884 the opening of the Lungotevere involved the destruction of a part of the gardens and of the loggia on the river, which perhaps had been designed by Raphael. As already mentioned, it has belonged to the Italian State since 1927, which had it restored in 1929 -1942 to be assigned to the Academy of Italy and on several occasions in 1969-1983.
Today it is used by the Accademia dei Lincei as a representative office and houses, on the first floor, the national print cabinet.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Silvia La morgia; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>Unfortunately it is only for work that I go there.

Peruzzi decorated some of the interiors himself, such as the Sala della Prospettiva upstairs, in which illusionistic frescoes create the impression of looking out over Rome through a marble colonnade.

(Making a booking is absolutely necessary)<br><br><b>Author: </b>Levent Parman; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>Jazz¬†is a¬†music genre¬†that originated in the¬†African-American¬†communities of¬†New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in¬†blues¬†and¬†ragtime.¬†Since the 1920s¬†Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in¬†traditional¬†and¬†popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and¬†European-American¬†musical parentage.¬†Jazz is characterized by¬†swing¬†and¬†blue notes,¬†call and response vocals,¬†polyrhythms¬†and¬†improvisation. Jazz has roots in¬†West African cultural and musical expression, and in¬†African-American music traditions.As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles.¬†New Orleans jazz¬†began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French¬†quadrilles,¬†biguine, ragtime and¬†blues¬†with collective¬†polyphonic¬†improvisation.
In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented¬†swing¬†big bands,¬†Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and¬†Gypsy jazz¬†(a style that emphasized¬†musette¬†waltzes) were the prominent styles.¬†Bebop¬†emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation.¬†Cool jazz¬†developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
The mid-1950s saw the emergence of¬†hard bop, which introduced influences from¬†rhythm and blues,¬†gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing.¬†Modal jazz¬†developed in the late 1950s, using the¬†mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did¬†free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures.¬†Jazz-rock fusion¬†appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with¬†rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called¬†smooth jazz¬†became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as¬†Latin¬†and¬†Afro-Cuban jazz.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Cary Ota; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Good music, but be ready to pay for the rest.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Paul Painter; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Jazz Club with no Jazz.

Emperor Trajan and his architect, Apollodorus of Damascus, built this visionary complex of 150 offices and shops in the early 2nd century AD. In their heyday, the markets sold everything from Middle Eastern silks and spices to fresh fish, fruit, and flowers.
Shops opened early and closed about noon. Almost all the shopping was done by men and the traders were almost exclusively male.
The Forum of Trajan (AD 107‚Äì13) was built in front of the market complex. It was a vast colonnaded open space with a huge basilica, and included two libraries.

Trajan's Market (Latin: Mercatus Traiani, Italian: Mercati di Traiano) is a large complex of ruins in the city of Rome, Italy, located on the Via dei Fori Imperiali, at the opposite end to the Colosseum. The surviving buildings and structures, built as an integral part of Trajan's Forum and nestled against the excavated flank of the Quirinal Hill, present a living model of life in the Roman capital and a glimpse at the restoration in the city, which reveals new treasures and insights about Ancient Roman architecture.

Thought to be the world's oldest shopping mall, the arcades in Trajan's Market are now believed by many to be administrative offices for Emperor Trajan. The shops and apartments were built in a multi-level structure and it is still possible to visit several of the levels. Highlights include delicate marble floors and the remains of a library.

Construction

Trajan's Market was probably built in 100-110 AD by Apollodorus of Damascus,an architect who always followed Trajan in his adventures and to whom Trajan entrusted the planning of his Forum,[and inaugurated in 113 AD.During the Middle Ages the complex was transformed by adding floor levels, still visible today, and defensive elements such as the Torre delle Milizie, the ""militia tower"" built in 1200. A convent, which was built in this area in the 16th century was acquired by the state in 1885 and became the Goffredo Mameli barracks.This was demolished at the beginning of the twentieth century to restore Trajan's Markets to the city of Rome.

In Piazza Nicosia, suffocated by parked cars, there is the beautiful fountain designed by Giacomo Della Porta.
Not just any one, because in Rome there are many works that bear his signature. But this one is not like the others and it was not as we see it today, because it was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, long before Valadier dedicated himself to it heart and soul with his genius.
What we see remains: the elevated octagonal basin, the elegant balustrade in cipollino marble and a basin decorated with heraldic emblems.
Only three small columns connected by two iron bars protect it from modernity.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Maria Tanasa; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>The fountain in Piazza Nicosia was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, was built in 1572 by Giacomo della Porta for Pope Gregory XIII Boncompagni, whose dragon we note on the basin, to inaugurate the restoration of the Virgin Aqueduct.
When Giuseppe Valadier carried out the current restyling of the Piazza del Popolo in 1823, it was demolished to be relocated to Piazza Nicosia in 1950, when renovation work was carried out on the area coordinated by the architect Marcello Piacentini.<br><br><b>Author: </b>vincenzo marsella; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 months ago<br>Beautiful fountain<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana del Trullo was designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1572.

Very beautiful is the octagonal basin, raised by two steps of the same shape, is the only original part left, the rest are reconstructions.

Fortunately it is protected by an area of ‚Äã‚Äãrespect delimited by columns, connected with iron bars.

Unfortunately, the vehicles parked around and the small size of the Piazza, do not give the right emphasis to the work.<br><br>",,PRK

We stayed here for 3 nights and had no problems, our room was cleaned every day, the breakfast was fresh and plentiful (not a lot of different things but enough for every taste) and the staff was very polite (from the reception to the cleaning and the kitchen). We also had an excellent spa day in the hotel with clean dry sauna, jacuzzi and hot steam Turkish bath.<br><br><b>Author: </b>massimo mancusi; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>2 months ago<br>60mt from the trevi fountain best location<br><br><b>Author: </b>Mel Levi; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>We stayed 5 nights from Nov 9-14th.  Very pleased with the hotel.  GREAT location.  Nice rooms and breakfast.  Staff is wonderful and very helpful.  First night we were put in a small room as hotel was at 100% occupancy.  They moved us to a very nice room for nights 2-5.  Would certainly stay there again and recommend.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Giovanna Gravina; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Terrible experience! dirty rooms with cigarette smells! bad breakfast with few options. I definitely don't recommend it. I think they disregard the whole because they are in a good location. Not to mention the time we arrived in the room, with cigarette butts in the toilet and sheets and room stinking of cigarettes. We just didn't change hotels because it was time to go back to our country. Not sure how it fits into a 3 star hotel.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Erin G; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Three stars based on convenience and location.  I always keep an open mind when traveling abroad, and when staying in bigger cities I expect to pay more for a hotel room.  This hotel is definitely on the pricier side.  However, I wasn‚Äôt in Rome to hang out in a hotel room.  It was a place to sleep and served its purpose.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It‚Äôs around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn‚Äôt the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren‚Äôt the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL
