We stayed here for 3 nights and had no problems, our room was cleaned every day, the breakfast was fresh and plentiful (not a lot of different things but enough for every taste) and the staff was very polite (from the reception to the cleaning and the kitchen).

I definitely don't recommend it. I think they disregard the whole because they are in a good location. Not to mention the time we arrived in the room, with cigarette butts in the toilet and sheets and room stinking of cigarettes. We just didn't change hotels because it was time to go back to our country. Not sure how it fits into a 3 star hotel.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Erin G; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Three stars based on convenience and location.  I always keep an open mind when traveling abroad, and when staying in bigger cities I expect to pay more for a hotel room.  This hotel is definitely on the pricier side.  However, I wasn‚Äôt in Rome to hang out in a hotel room.  It was a place to sleep and served its purpose.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It‚Äôs around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn‚Äôt the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren‚Äôt the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL

Nice to go and see as a monument, and then continue to more interesting gems in the city

Don't eat there, and don't sit there for coffee!
It is not worth it
You will have an amazing experience to watch, but that is it

Also, the police don't allow to sit on the stairs, so watch out

And the fountain below them is with drinkable water

The long stairs, the obelisk, church on the hill and the interesting Bernini fountain make this square unique in the world. At Spanish Steps is always a good atmosphere, always with lots of cheerful young people.
Above Spanish Steps is the beautiful church of Trinit√† dei Monti. In front of the church is the obelisk in the glory of the Immaculate Conception which was created as a compromise between the Papal States and France,who wanted to erect a monument to King Louis XIV.
Also interesting is the Fontana della Barcaccia, was made in memory of a flood of the Tiber in the late 16th century, when at that place, after the withdrawal of water, remained stranded boat.
It's certainly a must-see on any walking trip around Rome.<br><br>",,TOUR

Inside a staff assistant will lead the 8 customers and check they will move to the following room after the maximum time of 5 minutes spent in the previous. So it is better to study Raffaello works before the exhibit and any time you enter a room it is better TO FOCUS AND GO STRAIGHT TO THE OBJECTS YOU PREFER and then if there is time left look the rest.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It‚Äôs around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn‚Äôt the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren‚Äôt the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL
