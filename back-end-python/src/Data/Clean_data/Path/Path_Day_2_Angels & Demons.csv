We chose this hotel during the pandemic for its convenient location to the Vatican and its restaurant and bar. We were disappointed that both evening occasions in the roof top bar our waiter (same both evenings) was not accommodating and somewhat rude. On our last night we asked to sit on top and they said it was closed, and seated us on the lower level, then a half hour later we saw service occurring upstairs - why pay for a supreme view of as a guest you can‚Äôt access it during ‚Äúopen‚Äù hours? We settled for the Lower level, still nice views and then at 10:55 we asked for one more drink - people had bottles of wine on ice still so we figured good to go.

We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn‚Äôt care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn‚Äôt see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that‚Äôs a normal thing. They didn‚Äôt even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn‚Äôt bother to call me.

We went late afternoon without a line stopping us to enter the museum quickly. By entrance you get a map of the museum with pictures of the objects on it. With a little scanner, headphone included, you can tab on the picture what is relevant at the moment you stand in front of an object. You will here a voice in your selected language explaining the background of the piece. Several mechanical creations can be tried. By doing this you get close in the genius mind of Leonardo Da Vinci and realize he went far in front of his era. Also for kids this is a very educative museum wich stimulates the mind. After the tour in the museum you can buy fun souvenirs like T-shirts, books, etc.<br><br>",,MUSE
