This hotel has a magical leg up on all others - the view! Yes, you will pay more for it but WOW. It is special to come home after touring Rome and sit atop a roof gazing at St Peters Basilica and looking over the city. We did this every night and every morning ❤️
The staff! Amazing, nice, well spoken and support needs and requests in a timely manner (speak many languages!)
Cleanliness!(with one exception see below)
Breakfast - full breakfast that included Italian favorites (cornetti yum!) and traditional American (bacon and eggs yum!)
Drinks! Delicious
Coffee - hot and ready!

What wasn’t so great:
We chose this hotel during the pandemic for its convenient location to the Vatican and its restaurant and bar. We were disappointed that both evening occasions in the roof top bar our waiter (same both evenings) was not accommodating and somewhat rude. On our last night we asked to sit on top and they said it was closed, and seated us on the lower level, then a half hour later we saw service occurring upstairs - why pay for a supreme view of as a guest you can’t access it during “open” hours? We settled for the Lower level, still nice views and then at 10:55 we asked for one more drink - people had bottles of wine on ice still so we figured good to go. We were told by the waiter “ no the bar is closed” he then walked upstairs to the roof top area weren’t allowed to drink at. We continued to wait for our bill only to see the bartender make another full tray of drinks and coffee. What??!?! We were stung a bit but shrugged it off. Just felt wrong.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Lessley Ann; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>We took advantage of fabulous postcorona offer. And for the price we got more than expected.

We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn’t care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn’t see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that’s a normal thing. They didn’t even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn’t bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.

Good food great Jazz. (Making a booking is absolutely necessary)<br><br><b>Author: </b>Levent Parman; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions.As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.
In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Cary Ota; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Good music, but be ready to pay for the rest.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Paul Painter; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Jazz Club with no Jazz.

This hotel has a magical leg up on all others - the view! Yes, you will pay more for it but WOW. It is special to come home after touring Rome and sit atop a roof gazing at St Peters Basilica and looking over the city. We did this every night and every morning ❤️
The staff! Amazing, nice, well spoken and support needs and requests in a timely manner (speak many languages!)
Cleanliness!(with one exception see below)
Breakfast - full breakfast that included Italian favorites (cornetti yum!) and traditional American (bacon and eggs yum!)
Drinks! Delicious
Coffee - hot and ready!

What wasn’t so great:
We chose this hotel during the pandemic for its convenient location to the Vatican and its restaurant and bar. We were disappointed that both evening occasions in the roof top bar our waiter (same both evenings) was not accommodating and somewhat rude. On our last night we asked to sit on top and they said it was closed, and seated us on the lower level, then a half hour later we saw service occurring upstairs - why pay for a supreme view of as a guest you can’t access it during “open” hours? We settled for the Lower level, still nice views and then at 10:55 we asked for one more drink - people had bottles of wine on ice still so we figured good to go. We were told by the waiter “ no the bar is closed” he then walked upstairs to the roof top area weren’t allowed to drink at. We continued to wait for our bill only to see the bartender make another full tray of drinks and coffee. What??!?! We were stung a bit but shrugged it off. Just felt wrong.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Lessley Ann; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>We took advantage of fabulous postcorona offer. And for the price we got more than expected. A modern room and breakfast in an outstanding panoramatic rooftop restaurant with huge glass windows. Internet worked well. Nothing to complain about.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Chacha Durazo; <br><b>Rating: </b>2<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>Our AC doesn't work. The room is incredibly dated and questionably clean. Location is great but I will definitely look elsewhere in the future. They left our bags in the main lobby for several hours unattended even though we were promised they would put them in our room (we checked in early but as the room wasn't ready, we left our bags and returned in the evening several hours later). Carpet everywhere which is gross. Definitely not the 4 star they market themselves as.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Marek Grabowski; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>7 months ago<br>SCAM, BEWARE - THIEFS OPERATE IN THE HOTEL

We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn’t care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn’t see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that’s a normal thing. They didn’t even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn’t bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.
CHOOSE THIS HOTEL FOR YOUR OWN RISK.<br><br><b>Author: </b>philip carroll; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>6 months ago<br>Staff where fantastic rooms very clean would go back any time 🍀<br><br>",,HOTEL
