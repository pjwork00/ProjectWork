Very nice & helpful folks all around this amazing hotel. Great rooms in a great neighborhood to stroll around in. At Christmas, there's a small x-mas market next door, and it's near a million shops.

From the lounge, you can see the only entrance/exit from the children's playroom, so if you want to grab an espresso or something stronger, you can keep an eye on your kids (6yoa & 7 yoa at the time of this writing). If you do stop by the bar, ask for Fares (Ferris), a very understanding bartender who doesn't bat an eyelash when you run to the playroom to see who's crying!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Anastasiya Maykut; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>I came to Paris for my 20th birthday.

By far the best Novotel I’ve stayed in. From the point of approaching the front door, the staff were completely on point. They were amazingly nice and accommodating. We were able to check into our room early. The room is spacious and well equipped. It’s modern and clean with 2 beds. Extremely happy with my choice and wouldn’t think of staying on another hotel<br><br><b>Author: </b>Federica Marzola; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>There are so many reasons why I love this hotel!
First of all: Kindness!
Here I found the best receptionist ever: Djamel! He’s very kind and he will help you to find everything you’re looking for spend a great holiday! He will do the best he can to be sure you have all you need! So if you are staying in this hotel, ask for him!
Second: this hotel is located right in the city centre so in few minutes by walk you have the opportunity to visit the most famous attractions! If you prefer use the public transport, the underground station in right in front of the entrance of the hotel!
Third: the hotel is clean and you can also enjoy a great and continental breakfast, full of delicious croissants and waffles and cheese!

Ci sono molte ragioni per cui amo questo hotel!
Prima di tutto: gentilezza!
Qui ho trovato il receptionist migliore in assoluto: Djamel! Lui è molto gentile e ti aiuterà a trovare tutto ciò che stai cercando per trascorrere la tua vacanza nel migliore dei modi! Lui farà tutto ciò che può per assicurarsi che tu stia comodo e abbia ciò di cui hai bisogno. Quindi... se decidete di stare qui, chiedete di Djamel!
Secondo: l’hotel è situato nel centro della città e in pochi minuti si ha la possibilità di   Raggiungere (a piedi o in metro) le attrazioni più famose. (La stazione della metro è proprio davanti all’entrata dell’hotel).
Per concludere: la colazione e la pulizia dell’hotel sono eccezionali.
Raccomando vivamente questo posto😘<br><br>",,HOTEL

Very nice & helpful folks all around this amazing hotel. Great rooms in a great neighborhood to stroll around in. At Christmas, there's a small x-mas market next door, and it's near a million shops.

From the lounge, you can see the only entrance/exit from the children's playroom, so if you want to grab an espresso or something stronger, you can keep an eye on your kids (6yoa & 7 yoa at the time of this writing). If you do stop by the bar, ask for Fares (Ferris), a very understanding bartender who doesn't bat an eyelash when you run to the playroom to see who's crying!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Anastasiya Maykut; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>I came to Paris for my 20th birthday.

Third: the hotel is clean and you can also enjoy a great and continental breakfast, full of delicious croissants and waffles and cheese!

Ci sono molte ragioni per cui amo questo hotel!
Prima di tutto: gentilezza!

Lui farà tutto ciò che può per assicurarsi che tu stia comodo e abbia ciò di cui hai bisogno. Quindi... se decidete di stare qui, chiedete di Djamel!
Secondo: l’hotel è situato nel centro della città e in pochi minuti si ha la possibilità di   Raggiungere (a piedi o in metro) le attrazioni più famose. (La stazione della metro è proprio davanti all’entrata dell’hotel).
Per concludere: la colazione e la pulizia dell’hotel sono eccezionali.
Raccomando vivamente questo posto😘<br><br>",,HOTEL
