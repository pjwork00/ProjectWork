Very nice & helpful folks all around this amazing hotel. Great rooms in a great neighborhood to stroll around in. At Christmas, there's a small x-mas market next door, and it's near a million shops.

From the lounge, you can see the only entrance/exit from the children's playroom, so if you want to grab an espresso or something stronger, you can keep an eye on your kids (6yoa & 7 yoa at the time of this writing).

Second: this hotel is located right in the city centre so in few minutes by walk you have the opportunity to visit the most famous attractions! If you prefer use the public transport, the underground station in right in front of the entrance of the hotel!
Third: the hotel is clean and you can also enjoy a great and continental breakfast, full of delicious croissants and waffles and cheese!

Ci sono molte ragioni per cui amo questo hotel!
Prima di tutto: gentilezza!

Secondo: lâ€™hotel Ã¨ situato nel centro della cittÃ  e in pochi minuti si ha la possibilitÃ  di   Raggiungere (a piedi o in metro) le attrazioni piÃ¹ famose. (La stazione della metro Ã¨ proprio davanti allâ€™entrata dellâ€™hotel).
Per concludere: la colazione e la pulizia dellâ€™hotel sono eccezionali.
