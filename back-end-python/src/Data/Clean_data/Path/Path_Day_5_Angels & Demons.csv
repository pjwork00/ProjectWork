Very clean and spacious, although I think we had one of the better rooms. Bathroom was great. We had a balcony in the room and a balcony in the bathroom. We did some sink laundry and let it dry in the balcony. This was our plan so we wouldn't have to pack as much clothing.

It was easy to catch an uber or taco from this hotel. Walking distance to the subway which was easy to use. We were able to travel to many destinations by walking it taking the subway. I recommend getting a subway ticket that includes unlimited rides for x amount of time. I think we did 48 hours.

Breakfast had many options and was very good. While Rome itself was very dirty with trash pretty much all over this hotel was very clean inside and out. I would definitely return to this hotel.<br><br>",,HOTEL
