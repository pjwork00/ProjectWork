I always keep an open mind when traveling abroad, and when staying in bigger cities I expect to pay more for a hotel room.  This hotel is definitely on the pricier side.  However, I wasn’t in Rome to hang out in a hotel room.  It was a place to sleep and served its purpose.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It’s around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn’t the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren’t the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL

After a long day of sightseeing the day before, I was looking for a more child-friendly activity to take my daughter on our last full day in Rome. We arrived 30 minutes before our time slot and played on the outside zip line until it was time. As a mom, I enjoyed a delicious and cheap cappuccino. When it was our time to enter, it was an hour and 45 minutes of non-stop running around, learning, and exploring. My daughter really enjoyed herself (she’s 9), and didn’t become board. The allotted time was sufficient enough, and because they only sell a certain amount of tickets per time slot, this leaves for plenty of room for children to play without it feeling over crowded.

It’s not anything spectacular and is small. Definitely not worth your precious time in Rome. My kids were ready to leave before the allotted time was up. The only positives were that my children have a wide age gap (7 and 1) and both were able to play age appropriate activities. Also, we were in Rome during very hot temperatures in summer, and since most activities are outside in Rome, it was nice having an indoor activity planned.
