We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn‚Äôt care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn‚Äôt see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that‚Äôs a normal thing. They didn‚Äôt even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn‚Äôt bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.

We went late afternoon without a line stopping us to enter the museum quickly. By entrance you get a map of the museum with pictures of the objects on it. With a little scanner, headphone included, you can tab on the picture what is relevant at the moment you stand in front of an object. You will here a voice in your selected language explaining the background of the piece. Several mechanical creations can be tried. By doing this you get close in the genius mind of Leonardo Da Vinci and realize he went far in front of his era. Also for kids this is a very educative museum wich stimulates the mind. After the tour in the museum you can buy fun souvenirs like T-shirts, books, etc.<br><br>",,MUSE
