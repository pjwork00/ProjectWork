This hotel has a magical leg up on all others - the view! Yes, you will pay more for it but WOW. It is special to come home after touring Rome and sit atop a roof gazing at St Peters Basilica and looking over the city. We did this every night and every morning ‚ù§Ô∏è
The staff! Amazing, nice, well spoken and support needs and requests in a timely manner (speak many languages!)
Cleanliness!(with one exception see below)
Breakfast - full breakfast that included Italian favorites (cornetti yum!) and traditional American (bacon and eggs yum!)
Drinks! Delicious
Coffee - hot and ready!

What wasn‚Äôt so great:
We chose this hotel during the pandemic for its convenient location to the Vatican and its restaurant and bar. We were disappointed that both evening occasions in the roof top bar our waiter (same both evenings) was not accommodating and somewhat rude. On our last night we asked to sit on top and they said it was closed, and seated us on the lower level, then a half hour later we saw service occurring upstairs - why pay for a supreme view of as a guest you can‚Äôt access it during ‚Äúopen‚Äù hours? We settled for the Lower level, still nice views and then at 10:55 we asked for one more drink - people had bottles of wine on ice still so we figured good to go. We were told by the waiter ‚Äú no the bar is closed‚Äù he then walked upstairs to the roof top area weren‚Äôt allowed to drink at. We continued to wait for our bill only to see the bartender make another full tray of drinks and coffee. What??!?! We were stung a bit but shrugged it off. Just felt wrong.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Lessley Ann; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>We took advantage of fabulous postcorona offer. And for the price we got more than expected.

We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn‚Äôt care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn‚Äôt see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that‚Äôs a normal thing. They didn‚Äôt even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn‚Äôt bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.

It was founded in Rome in 1603 by Federico Cesi, Francesco Stelluti, Anastasio De Filiis and Johannes van Heeck, in order to establish a meeting place for the development of the sciences. Its name refers to the sharpness that must have the sight of those who dedicate themselves to the sciences, to the future and to human progress, a property that characterizes the lynx, in relation to sight.
The Accademia dei Lincei has undergone many changes over time. After a first period of great prestige, due to the work of Cesi and the other founders and to the presence of partners such as Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Battista Della Porta, after Cesi's death in 1630, the Academy reduced its activities to almost to disappear. Only in 1847 there was a real resumption of its activities by Pope Pius IX who re-founded it in the Pontifical Academy of the Nuovi Lincei, which still exists today.
Subsequently from 1936 with the name of Pontifical Academy of Sciences.
Since 1986 the Accademia dei Lincei has been governed by a Statute which provides for it to be composed of 540 academics, divided according to three qualifications. Therefore 180 are the ""national"" ordinary members, 180 the ""foreign"" ordinary members and 180 are the ""corresponding"" members. All members are then divided into two classes: the first is that of Physical Sciences, while the second is that of Moral Sciences. Since 2001 the Physical Sciences Class is divided into 5 categories, while the Moral Sciences Class is divided into 7 categories.
The academy is located in the Villa Farnesina, in Rome; it was built between 1506 and 1512 by the young Peruzzi for the very wealthy Sienese banker Agostino Chigi, a great patron and prominent figure in early 16th century Rome, who had amassed a large fortune from the proceeds of the sale of the Tolfa alum and who enjoyed the protection of Pope Julius II first, and then Leo X. The Farnesina, which at the time was simply called Villa Chigi, was the first suburban noble villa in Rome and had a great prominence from the beginning, soon being cited and imitated. The architectural interventions, although they could be considered completed in 1512, continued for other works until 1520.
With the death of Chigi, in 1520, the villa declined and was depleted of furnishings and works of art. In 1580 it was purchased by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and thus had its current name. An unrealized project dates back to this period to connect Palazzo Farnese with the Farnesina with a covered passage. In 1714 it became the property of the Bourbons of Naples and in 1864 the ambassador Bermudez de Castro settled there, who, two years later, promoted a series of heavy restorations.
In 1884 the opening of the Lungotevere involved the destruction of a part of the gardens and of the loggia on the river, which perhaps had been designed by Raphael. As already mentioned, it has belonged to the Italian State since 1927, which had it restored in 1929 -1942 to be assigned to the Academy of Italy and on several occasions in 1969-1983.
Today it is used by the Accademia dei Lincei as a representative office and houses, on the first floor, the national print cabinet.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Silvia La morgia; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>Unfortunately it is only for work that I go there.

This hotel has a magical leg up on all others - the view! Yes, you will pay more for it but WOW. It is special to come home after touring Rome and sit atop a roof gazing at St Peters Basilica and looking over the city. We did this every night and every morning ‚ù§Ô∏è
The staff! Amazing, nice, well spoken and support needs and requests in a timely manner (speak many languages!)
Cleanliness!(with one exception see below)
Breakfast - full breakfast that included Italian favorites (cornetti yum!) and traditional American (bacon and eggs yum!)
Drinks! Delicious
Coffee - hot and ready!

What wasn‚Äôt so great:
We chose this hotel during the pandemic for its convenient location to the Vatican and its restaurant and bar. We were disappointed that both evening occasions in the roof top bar our waiter (same both evenings) was not accommodating and somewhat rude. On our last night we asked to sit on top and they said it was closed, and seated us on the lower level, then a half hour later we saw service occurring upstairs - why pay for a supreme view of as a guest you can‚Äôt access it during ‚Äúopen‚Äù hours? We settled for the Lower level, still nice views and then at 10:55 we asked for one more drink - people had bottles of wine on ice still so we figured good to go. We were told by the waiter ‚Äú no the bar is closed‚Äù he then walked upstairs to the roof top area weren‚Äôt allowed to drink at. We continued to wait for our bill only to see the bartender make another full tray of drinks and coffee. What??!?! We were stung a bit but shrugged it off. Just felt wrong.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Lessley Ann; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>We took advantage of fabulous postcorona offer. And for the price we got more than expected. A modern room and breakfast in an outstanding panoramatic rooftop restaurant with huge glass windows. Internet worked well. Nothing to complain about.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Chacha Durazo; <br><b>Rating: </b>2<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>Our AC doesn't work. The room is incredibly dated and questionably clean. Location is great but I will definitely look elsewhere in the future. They left our bags in the main lobby for several hours unattended even though we were promised they would put them in our room (we checked in early but as the room wasn't ready, we left our bags and returned in the evening several hours later). Carpet everywhere which is gross. Definitely not the 4 star they market themselves as.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Marek Grabowski; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>7 months ago<br>SCAM, BEWARE - THIEFS OPERATE IN THE HOTEL

We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn‚Äôt care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn‚Äôt see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that‚Äôs a normal thing. They didn‚Äôt even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn‚Äôt bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.
CHOOSE THIS HOTEL FOR YOUR OWN RISK.<br><br><b>Author: </b>philip carroll; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>6 months ago<br>Staff where fantastic rooms very clean would go back any time üçÄ<br><br>",,HOTEL
