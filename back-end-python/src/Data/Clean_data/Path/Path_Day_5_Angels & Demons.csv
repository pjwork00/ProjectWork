The staff! Amazing, nice, well spoken and support needs and requests in a timely manner (speak many languages!)
Cleanliness!(with one exception see below)

Coffee - hot and ready!

We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn‚Äôt care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn‚Äôt see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that‚Äôs a normal thing. They didn‚Äôt even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn‚Äôt bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.

Really like this park because it is very beautiful,huge, well kept and it also have different view points.

Totally recommend this park if you just wanna go for some walk and especially if you have kids or dog!

A bit tricky to find a car park if you are coming with car.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Naz Shirani; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>Lovely park in Rome. So many beautiful turtles!

Avoid Viva Bistro, it was awful!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Khalid Sohail; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a month ago<br>Very nice, big park. Its excellent for running, cycling and even for picnics. There is a lake inside the park which is very beautiful. There is also a cafe Vivi that is very good.<br><br><b>Author: </b>MaryYa; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>Nice place for a wolk or sports activities. Plenty of space, high trees, lakes with adorable ducks. There is a villa house and green labyrinth on a territory but no access into it. Also searching for a parking place might be a struggle.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Pauline Marie Calimlim; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>Huge park with such beautiful surprises! Great for walks and exercise. It also has a children's playground and many benches to seat on.<br><br>",,PRK
