Extremely noisy rooms and 45 minutes waiting in the queue for breakfast!!

The WiFi signal is non-existent. The water in the shower in annoyingly weak!

It doesn't look anything like a 2 star hotel even.<br><br><b>Author: </b>David Connell; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great staff.  Very helpful.  Extremely professional.

I almost want to rate it 5 stars, but it was not perfect.  First, the service staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  In this hotel, the elevator is extremely small, a common hotel feature throughout Europe, so I got worried because my family brought a lot of luggage.  Yet, I think the staff is aware of this, so they offer to bring your luggage to your room, which created a good, initial impression on me.  In addition to the staff, I  liked the room my family got.  The room was very clean and modern-looking; furthermore, it also came with a nice, spacious patio!  After seeing my room, I still could not believe I was in a best western hotel.  The only reason why I can't give this hotel 5 stars is the room tends to get hot very easily.  The room has AC, but it is very weak.  Besides a few problems, I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Rome!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Sandy Kelver; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>We stayed 4 nights at this Best Western Plus hotel in Rome.  All the staff are friendly, helpful and make you feel welcomed from the minute you walk in the front door.  Rooms are a good size and very clean.  Bedding and towels are a nice quality.
