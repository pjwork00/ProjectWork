We received a room upgrade upon arrival, which was a nice gesture. If possible get a room with balcony as you can see the Dome from there. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the room was spacious and well-equipped as compared to other Rome hotels we have visited.  The hotel's staff was courteous and welcoming (apart for some of the waitresses at the restaurant, who were not very attentive - e.g. they would not ask if you need anything like espresso). The hotel is in a very convenient and quiet location. One thing that could be improved is the breakfast - while the variety was satisfactory, it was one and the same each morning. The New Year's buffet dinner was a bit of a disappointment - the mood was not particularly festive and it closed before the start of the new year. Food was also a bit on the bland side.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Bob P.; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great location near everything! Friendly staff with good english.

They gave me an ""upgraded"" room for the first 2 days for the original price but said I would either have to move to the cheaper room after that or pay the upgraded price to stay in the original room. I decided to stay put. Who wants to pack up and move? Long story short it might have been a simple bait and switch type of thing, but I'm not sure.

Very clean and spacious, although I think we had one of the better rooms. Bathroom was great. We had a balcony in the room and a balcony in the bathroom. We did some sink laundry and let it dry in the balcony. This was our plan so we wouldn't have to pack as much clothing.

It was easy to catch an uber or taco from this hotel. Walking distance to the subway which was easy to use. We were able to travel to many destinations by walking it taking the subway. I recommend getting a subway ticket that includes unlimited rides for x amount of time. I think we did 48 hours.

Breakfast had many options and was very good. While Rome itself was very dirty with trash pretty much all over this hotel was very clean inside and out. I would definitely return to this hotel.<br><br>",,HOTEL

History:

The fountain was built in a later period, but always in the 16th century and is attributed to Nanni di Baccio Bigio, who did some restoration work on the palace.

Description of the work:

The non-functioning fountain (mute) is quite graceful inside a niche, decorated with a valve there is a Putto embracing the tails of two dolphins in the shape of volutes under him, who have their mouths open, from which a time the water poured out on a pan.

Two niches frame the niche, adorned with bas-reliefs depicting masks and which have human figures as capitals which are surmounted by a broken lintel above which has two stars on the sides with eight points on the sides, probably heraldic symbols.

NOTE on the conservation status of the work:

It is not in good condition and a restoration activity is required that would require the integration of the deficiencies and a cleaning of the incrustations.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Paolo Emilio Capaldi; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 years ago<br>Pretty fountain in Via Giulia, leaning against the left corner of Palazzo Sacchetti, corner via the mullet.

At the center, above the Putto, there is a shell; close the top frame the stars, the Chigi family crest.<br><br>",,PRK

Rooms were clean and nice. Staff met accommodations. We only ate there for morning breakfast which was the same each morning. Not many additional amenities to the hotel. Very close to Vatican but far from other tourists stops<br><br><b>Author: </b>M G; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Elegant hotel located on a 5 minute walk from St. Peter's square. We received a room upgrade upon arrival, which was a nice gesture. If possible get a room with balcony as you can see the Dome from there. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the room was spacious and well-equipped as compared to other Rome hotels we have visited.  The hotel's staff was courteous and welcoming (apart for some of the waitresses at the restaurant, who were not very attentive - e.g. they would not ask if you need anything like espresso). The hotel is in a very convenient and quiet location. One thing that could be improved is the breakfast - while the variety was satisfactory, it was one and the same each morning. The New Year's buffet dinner was a bit of a disappointment - the mood was not particularly festive and it closed before the start of the new year. Food was also a bit on the bland side.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Bob P.; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great location near everything! Friendly staff with good english. That's important to me since I'm totally ignorant of other languages. I might have been "" put on the elevator"" a bit due to a ""reservation foul-up"" that wouldn't make the room price I had reserved available for 2 days. They gave me an ""upgraded"" room for the first 2 days for the original price but said I would either have to move to the cheaper room after that or pay the upgraded price to stay in the original room. I decided to stay put. Who wants to pack up and move? Long story short it might have been a simple bait and switch type of thing, but I'm not sure. Oh, the room is nice but I don't know what the ""upgrade might be"". Recommend none the less.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Kate Heltemes; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>This was our favorite hotel of our European vacation. Very clean and spacious, although I think we had one of the better rooms. Bathroom was great. We had a balcony in the room and a balcony in the bathroom. We did some sink laundry and let it dry in the balcony. This was our plan so we wouldn't have to pack as much clothing.

It was easy to catch an uber or taco from this hotel. Walking distance to the subway which was easy to use. We were able to travel to many destinations by walking it taking the subway. I recommend getting a subway ticket that includes unlimited rides for x amount of time. I think we did 48 hours.

Breakfast had many options and was very good. While Rome itself was very dirty with trash pretty much all over this hotel was very clean inside and out. I would definitely return to this hotel.<br><br>",,HOTEL
