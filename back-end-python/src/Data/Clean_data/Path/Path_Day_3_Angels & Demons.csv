I always keep an open mind when traveling abroad, and when staying in bigger cities I expect to pay more for a hotel room.  This hotel is definitely on the pricier side.  However, I wasn’t in Rome to hang out in a hotel room.  It was a place to sleep and served its purpose.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It’s around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn’t the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren’t the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL

Every time I try the history books, I rub my eyes to reread the events of this city.
In Piazza Nicosia, suffocated by parked cars, there is the beautiful fountain designed by Giacomo Della Porta.
Not just any one, because in Rome there are many works that bear his signature. But this one is not like the others and it was not as we see it today, because it was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, long before Valadier dedicated himself to it heart and soul with his genius.
What we see remains: the elevated octagonal basin, the elegant balustrade in cipollino marble and a basin decorated with heraldic emblems.
Only three small columns connected by two iron bars protect it from modernity.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Maria Tanasa; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>The fountain in Piazza Nicosia was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, was built in 1572 by Giacomo della Porta for Pope Gregory XIII Boncompagni, whose dragon we note on the basin, to inaugurate the restoration of the Virgin Aqueduct.
When Giuseppe Valadier carried out the current restyling of the Piazza del Popolo in 1823, it was demolished to be relocated to Piazza Nicosia in 1950, when renovation work was carried out on the area coordinated by the architect Marcello Piacentini.<br><br><b>Author: </b>vincenzo marsella; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 months ago<br>Beautiful fountain<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana del Trullo was designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1572.

Today it is located in Piazza Nicosia, it was placed here in 1950 (after having been dismantled for several years in the warehouses of the municipality).

Very beautiful is the octagonal basin, raised by two steps of the same shape, is the only original part left, the rest are reconstructions.

Fortunately it is protected by an area of ​​respect delimited by columns, connected with iron bars.

Unfortunately, the vehicles parked around and the small size of the Piazza, do not give the right emphasis to the work.<br><br>",,PRK

is a Roman Catholic church in Rome, not far from Piazza Navona. The church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to St. Denis the Areopagite and St. Louis IX, king of France. The church was designed by Giacomo della Porta and built by Domenico Fontana between 1518 and 1589, and completed through the personal intervention of Catherine de' Medici, who donated to it some property in the area. It is the national church in Rome of France.<br><br><b>Author: </b>George; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>The ceiling is covered in beautiful art.

Once home to the city’s poor, the neighborhood has witnessed a proliferation of fashionable clubs, restaurants, and boutiques.
At the heart of this charming quarter, overlooking an attractive traffic-free square, stands the Basilica of Santa Maria – probably the first official place of Christian worship in Rome. It was founded by Pope Callixtus I in the 3rd century, when Christianity was still a minority cult. According to legend, the church was built on the site where a fountain of oil had sprung up miraculously on the day that Christ was born.
The basilica became the focus of devotion to the Virgin Mary and today is famous for its splendid mosaics. Both the Madonna and Christ are among the figures depicted in the facade mosaics (c. 12th century), while in the apse is a stylized 12th-century mosaic portraying the Coronation of the Virgin. Below it are a series of realistic mosaic scenes from the life of Mary by the 13th-century Roman artist Pietro Cavallini. The oldest image of the Virgin is a 7th-century icon, which depicts her as a Byzantine empress flanked by a guard of angels. Another image of the Virgin and Child can be seen near the top of the campanile<br><br>",,TOUR

It was founded in Rome in 1603 by Federico Cesi, Francesco Stelluti, Anastasio De Filiis and Johannes van Heeck, in order to establish a meeting place for the development of the sciences. Its name refers to the sharpness that must have the sight of those who dedicate themselves to the sciences, to the future and to human progress, a property that characterizes the lynx, in relation to sight.
The Accademia dei Lincei has undergone many changes over time. After a first period of great prestige, due to the work of Cesi and the other founders and to the presence of partners such as Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Battista Della Porta, after Cesi's death in 1630, the Academy reduced its activities to almost to disappear. Only in 1847 there was a real resumption of its activities by Pope Pius IX who re-founded it in the Pontifical Academy of the Nuovi Lincei, which still exists today.
Subsequently from 1936 with the name of Pontifical Academy of Sciences.
Since 1986 the Accademia dei Lincei has been governed by a Statute which provides for it to be composed of 540 academics, divided according to three qualifications. Therefore 180 are the ""national"" ordinary members, 180 the ""foreign"" ordinary members and 180 are the ""corresponding"" members. All members are then divided into two classes: the first is that of Physical Sciences, while the second is that of Moral Sciences. Since 2001 the Physical Sciences Class is divided into 5 categories, while the Moral Sciences Class is divided into 7 categories.
The academy is located in the Villa Farnesina, in Rome; it was built between 1506 and 1512 by the young Peruzzi for the very wealthy Sienese banker Agostino Chigi, a great patron and prominent figure in early 16th century Rome, who had amassed a large fortune from the proceeds of the sale of the Tolfa alum and who enjoyed the protection of Pope Julius II first, and then Leo X. The Farnesina, which at the time was simply called Villa Chigi, was the first suburban noble villa in Rome and had a great prominence from the beginning, soon being cited and imitated. The architectural interventions, although they could be considered completed in 1512, continued for other works until 1520.
With the death of Chigi, in 1520, the villa declined and was depleted of furnishings and works of art. In 1580 it was purchased by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and thus had its current name. An unrealized project dates back to this period to connect Palazzo Farnese with the Farnesina with a covered passage. In 1714 it became the property of the Bourbons of Naples and in 1864 the ambassador Bermudez de Castro settled there, who, two years later, promoted a series of heavy restorations.
In 1884 the opening of the Lungotevere involved the destruction of a part of the gardens and of the loggia on the river, which perhaps had been designed by Raphael. As already mentioned, it has belonged to the Italian State since 1927, which had it restored in 1929 -1942 to be assigned to the Academy of Italy and on several occasions in 1969-1983.
Today it is used by the Accademia dei Lincei as a representative office and houses, on the first floor, the national print cabinet.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Silvia La morgia; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>Unfortunately it is only for work that I go there.

Designed by the Sienese architect Baldassare Peruzzi, the harmonious Farnesina, with a central block and projecting wings, is one of the first true Renaissance villas. Peruzzi decorated some of the interiors himself, such as the Sala della Prospettiva upstairs, in which illusionistic frescoes create the impression of looking out over Rome through a marble colonnade.
The painted vault of the Sala di Galatea shows the position of the stars at the time of Chigi’s birth.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It’s around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn’t the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren’t the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br><br>",,HOTEL
