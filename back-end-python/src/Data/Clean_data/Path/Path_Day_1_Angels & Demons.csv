This hotel has a magical leg up on all others - the view! Yes, you will pay more for it but WOW. It is special to come home after touring Rome and sit atop a roof gazing at St Peters Basilica and looking over the city. We did this every night and every morning ‚ù§Ô∏è
The staff! Amazing, nice, well spoken and support needs and requests in a timely manner (speak many languages!)
Cleanliness!(with one exception see below)
Breakfast - full breakfast that included Italian favorites (cornetti yum!) and traditional American (bacon and eggs yum!)
Drinks! Delicious
Coffee - hot and ready!

What wasn‚Äôt so great:
We chose this hotel during the pandemic for its convenient location to the Vatican and its restaurant and bar. We were disappointed that both evening occasions in the roof top bar our waiter (same both evenings) was not accommodating and somewhat rude. On our last night we asked to sit on top and they said it was closed, and seated us on the lower level, then a half hour later we saw service occurring upstairs - why pay for a supreme view of as a guest you can‚Äôt access it during ‚Äúopen‚Äù hours? We settled for the Lower level, still nice views and then at 10:55 we asked for one more drink - people had bottles of wine on ice still so we figured good to go. We were told by the waiter ‚Äú no the bar is closed‚Äù he then walked upstairs to the roof top area weren‚Äôt allowed to drink at.

We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn‚Äôt care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn‚Äôt see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that‚Äôs a normal thing. They didn‚Äôt even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn‚Äôt bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.
