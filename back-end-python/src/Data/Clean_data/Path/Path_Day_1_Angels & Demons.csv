We received a room upgrade upon arrival, which was a nice gesture. If possible get a room with balcony as you can see the Dome from there. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the room was spacious and well-equipped as compared to other Rome hotels we have visited.  The hotel's staff was courteous and welcoming (apart for some of the waitresses at the restaurant, who were not very attentive - e.g. they would not ask if you need anything like espresso). The hotel is in a very convenient and quiet location. One thing that could be improved is the breakfast - while the variety was satisfactory, it was one and the same each morning. The New Year's buffet dinner was a bit of a disappointment - the mood was not particularly festive and it closed before the start of the new year. Food was also a bit on the bland side.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Bob P.; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great location near everything! Friendly staff with good english. That's important to me since I'm totally ignorant of other languages. I might have been "" put on the elevator"" a bit due to a ""reservation foul-up"" that wouldn't make the room price I had reserved available for 2 days. They gave me an ""upgraded"" room for the first 2 days for the original price but said I would either have to move to the cheaper room after that or pay the upgraded price to stay in the original room. I decided to stay put. Who wants to pack up and move? Long story short it might have been a simple bait and switch type of thing, but I'm not sure. Oh, the room is nice but I don't know what the ""upgrade might be"".

Very clean and spacious, although I think we had one of the better rooms. Bathroom was great. We had a balcony in the room and a balcony in the bathroom. We did some sink laundry and let it dry in the balcony. This was our plan so we wouldn't have to pack as much clothing.

It was easy to catch an uber or taco from this hotel. Walking distance to the subway which was easy to use. We were able to travel to many destinations by walking it taking the subway. I recommend getting a subway ticket that includes unlimited rides for x amount of time. I think we did 48 hours.

Breakfast had many options and was very good. While Rome itself was very dirty with trash pretty much all over this hotel was very clean inside and out. I would definitely return to this hotel.<br><br>",,HOTEL

Good food great Jazz. (Making a booking is absolutely necessary)<br><br><b>Author: </b>Levent Parman; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions.As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.
In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Cary Ota; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Good music, but be ready to pay for the rest.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Paul Painter; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Jazz Club with no Jazz.

The hotel's staff was courteous and welcoming (apart for some of the waitresses at the restaurant, who were not very attentive - e.g. they would not ask if you need anything like espresso). The hotel is in a very convenient and quiet location. One thing that could be improved is the breakfast - while the variety was satisfactory, it was one and the same each morning.

We did some sink laundry and let it dry in the balcony. This was our plan so we wouldn't have to pack as much clothing.

It was easy to catch an uber or taco from this hotel. Walking distance to the subway which was easy to use. We were able to travel to many destinations by walking it taking the subway. I recommend getting a subway ticket that includes unlimited rides for x amount of time. I think we did 48 hours.

Breakfast had many options and was very good. While Rome itself was very dirty with trash pretty much all over this hotel was very clean inside and out. I would definitely return to this hotel.<br><br>",,HOTEL
