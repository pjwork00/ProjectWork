I asked them to replace it and had to go downstairs every day I stayed at this hotel. The last two days of my trip I received a new card for my room twice. One in the morning, one at night. The staff would apologize and wouldn’t do anything to solve the main problem.

It’s frustrating to go up and down to find out that I can’t get into the room.

The room service left my room door open after cleaning it our second day. The heat would barely work and I would come back to my room finding the window wide open.

It’s 40 degrees out. I stayed here 6 days and I checked out leaving sick.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Jaime Plath; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>We spent two nights at the Westin Vendome for our New Years trip to Paris.  We were beyond excited to be in the city of love! Upon arrival at the Westin we were told the room wasn’t ready although we were there at the scheduled check in time of 3pm.

The front desk staff did everything they could do to find us a room that was cleaned and ready but as Titanium Elite members we had already been upgraded to the largest room in our room category they had available.  We were obviously ready to hit the ground running and get out into the city but we were requested to wait until our room was ready.  However that time was undetermined so we were given a courtesy drink at the bar for each of us. While they held our luggage we made our way to the bar where we were delightfully surprised at the ambiance and friendly staff.  Plus the drinks were delicious!  We thought it was an amazing start to our few days in Paris as we sat enjoying our cocktails and snacks. After an hour our room was still not ready and the staff comped another round of drinks for us. Although it was frustrating not to be able to get in and clean up after arriving from the long trip and embarking on the city but we really enjoyed the relaxed start to the weekend and were thankful for the time at the bar.
Once we got checked into our room we were able to get to the streets of Paris!  We made it back to our room later that night to find a bottle of champagne and chocolate provided on the house!    We were recently engaged and couldn’t have been more pleased at the service the Westin was providing. Excellent touch!  The following evening we were upgraded to a suite which exceeded out expectation! It was HUGE!  We had two balconies which gave us a view of the Tuileries garden.  We thoroughly enjoyed the extra space especially the sitting room area.  Lastly of note was the breakfast, which was comprised of a full buffet including everything from pastries & coffees to made to order eggs.  We enjoyed this every morning as a perfect start to our day.  We would highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Paris - great location, excellent amenities & incredible staff.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Alex Everything; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>7 months ago<br>my stay was great. the staff are helpful and the rooms are well furnished.i have used this hotel for all my Paris trips. it has a great continental breakfast with everything from sushi to omelets.  so if I could I would rate it not 1 not 2 not the not four not five but six stars.

The show is in a smaller room upstairs where they cram quite a bit of people. Fortunately, they don’t let people smoke up there. Chairs are not very comfortable. Drinks are good and prices are 10-14€ per drink. Go before the live shows and happy hour downstairs is fun with cheaper drinks. Server was very friendly although a little slow since he was the only one upstairs attending to the live music room.

Look this place up online first to see who is playing what night, but honestly I’ve never been to a bad show here. All of their musicians are fantastic. On your next trip to Paris make this a stop, it will end up being one of the highlights of your trip. Remember to show up when the doors open so that you can ensure you get a good seat.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Hailey Frazier; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>A hidden Jazz Gem! My husband and I had the most charming date night EVER here! The live underground swing band was amazing and we danced the night away!! It’s located in a great spot so you can easily grab food before or after going dancing!

There was a decent sized crowd, small enough to still feel intimate but large enough to have a blast!

We will be visiting again, on our next trip!!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Dev; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Absolutely memorable night of fantastic music and dancing, and watching all the couples dance to jazz was truly a night to remember!

I asked them to replace it and had to go downstairs every day I stayed at this hotel. The last two days of my trip I received a new card for my room twice. One in the morning, one at night. The staff would apologize and wouldn’t do anything to solve the main problem.

It’s frustrating to go up and down to find out that I can’t get into the room.

The room service left my room door open after cleaning it our second day. The heat would barely work and I would come back to my room finding the window wide open.

It’s 40 degrees out. I stayed here 6 days and I checked out leaving sick.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Jaime Plath; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>We spent two nights at the Westin Vendome for our New Years trip to Paris.  We were beyond excited to be in the city of love! Upon arrival at the Westin we were told the room wasn’t ready although we were there at the scheduled check in time of 3pm.

The front desk staff did everything they could do to find us a room that was cleaned and ready but as Titanium Elite members we had already been upgraded to the largest room in our room category they had available.  We were obviously ready to hit the ground running and get out into the city but we were requested to wait until our room was ready.  However that time was undetermined so we were given a courtesy drink at the bar for each of us. While they held our luggage we made our way to the bar where we were delightfully surprised at the ambiance and friendly staff.  Plus the drinks were delicious!  We thought it was an amazing start to our few days in Paris as we sat enjoying our cocktails and snacks. After an hour our room was still not ready and the staff comped another round of drinks for us. Although it was frustrating not to be able to get in and clean up after arriving from the long trip and embarking on the city but we really enjoyed the relaxed start to the weekend and were thankful for the time at the bar.
Once we got checked into our room we were able to get to the streets of Paris!  We made it back to our room later that night to find a bottle of champagne and chocolate provided on the house!    We were recently engaged and couldn’t have been more pleased at the service the Westin was providing. Excellent touch!  The following evening we were upgraded to a suite which exceeded out expectation! It was HUGE!  We had two balconies which gave us a view of the Tuileries garden.  We thoroughly enjoyed the extra space especially the sitting room area.  Lastly of note was the breakfast, which was comprised of a full buffet including everything from pastries & coffees to made to order eggs.  We enjoyed this every morning as a perfect start to our day.  We would highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Paris - great location, excellent amenities & incredible staff.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Alex Everything; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>7 months ago<br>my stay was great. the staff are helpful and the rooms are well furnished.i have used this hotel for all my Paris trips. it has a great continental breakfast with everything from sushi to omelets.  so if I could I would rate it not 1 not 2 not the not four not five but six stars.
