It wasn't until I got closer that I noticed that there was also a fountain. The fountain did look interesting but it was hard to see since it wasn't lit up much. It was also quite busy around the area so it was hard to get to the island with the obelisk and the fountain. It is an interesting thing to look at if you're in the area.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Sa√Øf AL-TEKREETI; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Twelve different sculptors worked on the statuary of the fountains, closely supervised by Hittorff, who made sure that the entire ensemble would be harmonious and balanced.
A prominent feature of the design of both fountains was a mushroom-shaped cap above the central vasque.
Water was to jet from the top of the cap and then cascade downward into a circular vasque, then down into a large circular basin below.
The major figures of the fountains were made of cast iron, florentined, or painted with bronze and gold paint. The smaller figures of the¬†tritons¬†and¬†nereids¬†were made of bronze.
Between 1833 and 1840, Hittdorff modified the plans several times.
In 1835, when a government committee reported that the water supply would not be sufficient for four new fountains, he reduced the number to two. The obelisk was put in place on the square on October 25, 1836. Both fountains were completed in May, 1840.
In 1862‚Äì63, the fountains were restored, and the bronze and gold paint was replaced with a bronze coating.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Jitendra Singh; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The set of 2 fountains is a masterpiece and it's beauty cannot be defined in words. The art on these though I don't know their symbols meaning but looks like every small part of it wants to tell you something.
When fountains are running you can keep looking at them and that will give relax to your eyes. Seeing them at sunset or having sunrays falling from between clouds will make you feel that you have seen something gorgeous.
All in all a very beautiful place to visit.<br><br>",PRK
