He reassured me that I would be reimbursed for my rolex and the cash that had been stolen, however that the insurance would take about a month to get back to him. Two month went pass he never answered my phone and at the end I managed to speak to him after he sent me an email saying that The insurance company at 99% will not be able to refund anything since there was not any break-in sign to the safe.

Apart the style, baroc everywhere, but it can be nice if you like it or you have a nice approach, but unfortunately the chambers were completely old style and also it wasn't almost impossible flush the toilet properly.
Service is nice, 'of course, is a Plaza hotel, but I think the price was overestimated for the offert.

Wifi worked for 1 night and the rest  nights it was not working. Even on the phone people hang up on you without saying goodbye. Bad front desk service especially the night shift. Ordered a mini van to the airport and didn’t get a confirmation and when I called to confirm and It was forgotten about. I would sacrifice the location for a better service.<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

Not to mention the time we arrived in the room, with cigarette butts in the toilet and sheets and room stinking of cigarettes. We just didn't change hotels because it was time to go back to our country. Not sure how it fits into a 3 star hotel.<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Erin G; Rating: 3; When: a year ago <br> Three stars based on convenience and location.  I always keep an open mind when traveling abroad, and when staying in bigger cities I expect to pay more for a hotel room.  This hotel is definitely on the pricier side.  However, I wasn’t in Rome to hang out in a hotel room.  It was a place to sleep and served its purpose.

Pros:   Convenience and location.  It’s around the corner from the Trivi Fountain, walking distance to all the touristy spots and easy to find.  Complimentary breakfast and nice kitchen staff.   They were kind enough to let me borrow a wine opener, and in no hurry to have me return it.   Hot tea in the lobby...sometimes.

Cons:  This wasn’t the cleanest hotel.  The rooms and restrooms weren’t the cleanest.  Over priced and very loud.  You can hear people talking in the hallways and in the other rooms.  Looks like they are remodeling.

Bottom Line:  If this hotel did a better job cleaning the hotel rooms and restrooms I would stay here again.<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

Cozy and very clean room. Friendly and helpful staff. Stunning communal areas.

Very nice breakfast with ample selection.

A 10 minute walk to the Metro which was perfect for commuting into the city centre (another 10 minutes, max) and to the attractions. Also close to a tram stop, which we didn't use as we found the Metro more convenient.

Plenty of lovely restaurants and shops nearby- negating the need to travel into the city centre every evening for dinner. These restaurants tended to be slightly cheaper than those in the city centre and better quality. Also around a 20 minute walk from the Vatican.

The only thing that the room lacked was tea and coffee making facilities- but this really wasn't a problem.<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Dmac Efc; Rating: 5; When: a year ago <br> Excellent hotel special mention to Luke the barman supperb<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Dawn Hollyoake; Rating: 5; When: a year ago <br> Lovely stay.

We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn’t care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn’t see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that’s a normal thing. They didn’t even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn’t bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.

All the main attractions are walking distance from this hotel, except a short taxi to Vatican. The surrounding area felt very safe since it was on a busy street close to many restaurants and big shops. The staff are very nice and the rooms are clean, but a bit small.

Because of the global pandemic, I asked to be refunded for the stay, specifying that a stay in one of the countries most affected by the epidemic was risky for us given our respective health conditions. They would not listen. All they proposed was a postponement of dates via the Booking.com website, but not a ticket, to avoid being obliged to refund them when the deadline expired. 4 stars and this hotel did not even make even a commercial gesture, despite my repeated requests and the fact that we are facing a force majeure event. I find this shameful. Some very small hotels that have lost much more in the crisis are refunding without question. I absolutely advise against this hotel, no understanding customer service. If I could, I wouldn't have put any stars on.

🇨🇵 J'avais réservé 4 nuits dans cet hôtel pour les 18 ans de mon frère cet été. À cause de la pandémie mondiale, j'ai demandé à être remboursée du séjour, en précisant qu'un séjour dans l'un des pays les plus touchés par l'épidémie était risqué pour nous au vu de nos états de santé respectifs. Ils n'ont rien voulu savoir. Tout ce qu'ils ont proposé, c'est un report de dates via le site Booking.com, mais pas d'avoir pour ne pas être obligés de le rembourser à expiration du délai. 4 étoiles et cet hôtel n'a même pas fait ne serait-ce qu'un geste commercial, malgré mes demandes répétées et le fait que nous faisons face à un évènement de force majeure. Je trouve cela honteux. Certains tout petits hôtels qui perdu bien plus dans la crise remboursent sans poser de questions. Je déconseille absolument cet hôtel, aucun service client compréhensif. Si j'avais pu, je n'aurais mis aucune étoile.<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: David Dugas; Rating: 5; When: a year ago <br> I've stayed with Hotel Cosmopolita on all three of my trips to Rome over the past four years and will continue to do so.  On each visit I notice they make small updates / enhancements, the front desk, hallways, and rooms are clean (spotless, really), I feel safe with the keycard entrance (on the way to the elevator), and the staff - so, so nice and helpful.  Really, the staff is great.  I'd also say that it is centrally located.  Walking north, south, east and west - you are right in the middle of all of the sights.  This is a ""highly recommended"" by me.

Clean - yes
Quiet - yes
Safe - yes
Staff - awesome
Location - great

When Rome gets hot it’s great to have a place where you can refresh in the afternoon. That said at the Gran Melia you also have to be prepared to share this pool with a loud and drunk crowd that plays music and screams around, so it’s not the most relaxing place. Unfortunately also the staff is not very caring. For example in my room the power went out and even after an hour I sat in the dark. The staff didn’t ask if there was any progress or just offered an other room. It’s just that, the staff doesn’t care here, a five star hotel shouldn’t leave that feeling in the end.

One major issue with communication: I called several times the hotel prior to my arrival, no answer. I sent an email, again, no answer.<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Rajiv Bhavsar; Rating: 1; When: 5 months ago <br> My friend and I checked in to the Villa Agrippina Hotel on Thursday, August 20, 2020.
The morning of the August, 20, 2020 is when everything went horribly wrong.
We woke up and went down for breakfast. After, we returned to the room to get ready for a scheduled tour of the Vatican. I asked my friend to get our passports from the safe. When he opened the safe, a wallet containing two passports, a driver’s license, 2000 Euros, $200 US dollars, a credit card and multiple sim cards were missing.
We begin to tear apart the room/our bags in case we ourselves had misplaced these items. We went through this process 3 times before my friend went down to reception.
At reception, he asked the hotel staff to check the log of scans to the room to see if anyone had entered while we were eating breakfast. The evening before we had entered the room at 7:30pm and then again at 1am after dinner. In the morning we entered at 10:30am. Allegedly, there had been no other entry scans.
He asked reception to double check as we were obviously beginning to panic at the disappearance of the wallet from the hotel safe. At this point, the staff refused to show us the print out of the entry log, only furthering our distress.
My friend returned to the room and we tore apart the room again. At that point, I myself went to reception and asked to speak with the Manager. The Manager arrived at our room and we asked him to review the cameras. He indicated that he needed a police warrant to do so.
However, when we asked him to call the police, he told us they would not come! The Manager did not seem to be interested in helping us find the missing wallet, nor in assisting us to figure out who entered our room and tampered with our locked safe.
Together with him, we searched our room, top to bottom, twice to no avail. We felt frustrated and disappointed with the lack of support and incompetent service, and demanded the Manager accompany us to the police station to file a report. This took an additional two hours.
At the police station, I pleaded with the Manager to please ask the staff to search the grounds of the hotel, as maybe someone threw away the wallet with the passports and took the cash. Our passports were what we cared about most. The Manager only agreed to this after pleading and pleading with him.
We returned to the hotel, the Manager, myself, my friend, and a housekeeper entered the room to tear it apart one more time. We began going through every item in the luggage. Flipped the mattress. Checked underneath the bed. Opened all the closets. Opened the safe and put our hands in every corner. Every section of the room was thoroughly swept.
The Manager and the housekeeper both concluded with us that the missing wallet containing our passports, cash, and credit cards were not in our room.
We spent the next 1.5-2 hours in the lobby with the Manager getting assistance on reissuing passports and rearranging our itinerary at our next destination with other hotels. After this, we returned the room.
We realized it was already 3:30pm and we had not eaten since the morning. My friend suggested we have lunch and I looked in the safe to find the wallet sitting exactly where we originally left it!!
Both of us were in complete disbelief. We ran downstairs to reception and were visibly in extreme distress. Shaking in anger. We asked for our car to immediately be brought to the front.
The Manager approached us and brazenly said “Oh I heard you found it” like nothing had happened! We were shocked by this.
We paid the bill as we no longer felt safe staying at the property. The blatant and disgusting behavior by the hotel is incomprehensible.
What we assume has happened is whoever took the wallet had returned it while we were downstairs with the Manager trying to figure out the situation with the consulate and our further bookings.
We immediately packed up our belongings and left the hotel<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

Don't book it, unless they confirm you in writing you get a room on the upper floors (4 5 6). Remaining floors are below the average and not worth the price they ask for.

My Wife is disabled and yet this was never a problem for us in our seven night stay, and staff consistently went out of their way to make our time in Rome memorable. The hotel has wonderful decoration and furnishings which are conducive to peaceful work or leisure. The internet connection was a little sporadic in our room and the television only has three or four channels broadcasting in English which is surprising given the number of British and American guests we encountered. However this in no way detracted from our experience.
Above all, as in every case, the crucial factor was the personnel, who were simply outstanding. Everyone from the Concierge to the restaurant staff to those who cleaned our room were a credit to their profession.

Pros: The staff was mostly friendly and helpful. The location is quite good if you’re looking to stay centrally downtown. The rooms were clean and provided the basic amenities. The breakfast was decent and fairly priced, considering that breakfast options can be somewhat limited in the area. We didn’t think the breakfast views that some people mention in other reviews were that great - nothing special.

Cons: The walls of our room looked worn and dirty. If you leave your windows open during any time of the day, you will be bombarded with sounds from the city during all times of the day and night. (Thankfully, no sound when the windows are closed and there is AC.) The shower is tiny and doesn’t leave much room to move around.

I had booked this place for 3 nights for my first trip to Rome with my wife. According to google this place is a hotel however from outside there were no signs apart from the sign on the door like an apartment building. Inside there are 6 rooms on the first floor so basically like an apartment but with seperate rooms for guests. I was taken aback but thought to give this a chance. On arriving I was told that unfortunately my room was due for maintenance on my last day there and so I would have to shift rooms. No attempts were made to notify me of this circumstance and they had apparently made arrangements for me to move to this other hotel where they have a room for me for that night. As I had prepaid I told them that they should have told me in advance as I don't like to change hotels and asked if I could just shift to the other hotel for my entire stay but this was denied and in remedy they offered to waive the city tax and pay for my airport transfer. This is just poor service as they took my money and couldn't even bother to tell me they can't accommodate me for my whole stay. The guy at the desk was very apologetic and that's the only ounce of good service I felt for my trip. The room itself is a small room in need of some work and the shower is the smallest I have ever seen. If you were to raise your elbows in the shower  you would hit the wall and the door at the same time The next morning breakfast came to the room with boiled eggs however the eggs turned out to be raw from the inside and not cooked at the slightest. I raised this with the manager and notified her that as I have a tour booked for the morning of the transfer to the other hotel I won't be able to change hotels till 3 pm and she said that would be fine to do at that time. However when the day of the move comes and I am ready to leave for my tour I was told by the guy at the desk to come by 1pm for the move. I told him I have a tour and I may not be able to and after much debate we settled on 2pm. This made me late for my Coliseum tour which again put a damper on the holiday. Lastly the hotel they transfered me to forgot to mention to me that the aircon in the room is broken so for my last night, in the height of summer I'm in a room with no ventilation, trying to sleep but failing on one of the hottest night.

The location was perfect. A short walk from plaza navona, the pantheon. Also walking distance from the vatican city and the Colosseum. As a tourist I basically walked everywhere from the hotel.

The place had such a lovely feel to it- the traditional porcelain flooring, wooden beams, window shutters. The place was cleaned everyday which was above and beyond what i expected. I didn't even ask for my room to be cleaned!

Beds were comfortable, and towels were clean. The place was well maintained.

Check in was easy, I informed the hosts of my late arrival by email and they accommodated it. No problems there.

I had some queries and issues with my safe key, and the hosts responded to my emails very promptly to resolve those problems and help me with my queries.

The hotel did not provide breakfast, nor did it have a 24 hr concierge service. In fact, I didn't meet the hosts or any receptionists at all. It was fine for me but for some this might be a bit strange and different to the conventional hotel. Theres also so much food around the hotel so not having a catering service was no issue at all.

The only 2 things that could have been a little bit better were the wifi and the showers. I was on the first floor and the wifi was temperamental. Nevertheless it did work majority of the time.

The showers had good pressures. The temperature however wasnt so good. The maximum temperature was probably around 37-38 degrees. If you wanted a particularly hot shower, it wasn't possible. Showers were hottest first thing in the morning. Not so hot at night.

I can't wait to go back again!!!!!!<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Razmyn Rahman; Rating: 5; When: a year ago <br> We are so glad to have found this very small boutique Hotel in Rome. Excellent location by the famous Via Condotti street and the Piazza Di Spagna, where the famous Spanish Steps are..Rooms and furnishings are a bit dated but they all adds to the experience.  Staffs are  very friendly and helpful. Excellent cleanliness and we got free continental breakfast as a bonus!! Loving this hotel and will be our first choice to stay again should we come to Rome again..<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Matthew Kent; Rating: 3; When: 2 years ago <br> Good location. Breakfast basic but included in the cost of room.  This is a bonus for a tourist as it was one less thing to think about when planning the day of attractions. The windows were not very sound proofed and let in a lot of the noise from the street - even in 3rd floor. Luckily the streets have minimal noise between 23:00 - 07:00.  Close to shops, attractions, and metro. Hotel is very quaint. If you are expecting modern rooms and styling you won't find it here. If you are looking for a perfectly functional hotel in a perfect location you can't go too wrong.<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Bianca De Sensi; Rating: 2; When: 2 years ago <br> Hotel is over priced for what you get. Can get better elsewhere in area. Rooms are tiny. My shower had very bad water pressure. Breakfast is extremely basic! Bed uncomfortable. Very noisy area. Only thing good is the location if you want to be close to everything. They stuffed up rooms with a family I was with. They booked for two separate rooms and had to sleep 3 people in one tiny room for 3 nights. No refund was given. They paid for our transfer to the train station which was around 16 euro. Doesn’t compensate for spending over 2k each in accommodation for 6 nights.<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Vu Le; Rating: 1; When: a year ago <br> Cancel your reservations for getting higher income.<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

Fabulous location surrounded by food and little shops!<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Maria Medina Romero; Rating: 3; When: a year ago <br> It is a pretty, clean place, with an unbeatable location. The staff is very friendly with the exception of the cleaning girls who clean their voices before 8 in the morning as if there were no guests in the next room, it is the only staff I have seen that does not spend care with their job.
And then we do not know very well what they are, but some small insects invaded our bed house night and they bit us, we notified reception and they changed the sheets but we still do not know where they come from but they still appear every night
If it weren't for those 2 inconveniences I would have 5 stars ✨<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Dina S; Rating: 2; When: a year ago <br> 1 star: location. Very comfortable, movable, everything is there and where to eat and shops.
2 star: staff, nice people at the reception, you can leave things after check-out, which helped us a lot to free all day from backpacks in front of the train.
Minus / plus it was warm, breakfast was in the wrong building, not across the street, but across the streets.
Minus soundproofing, not even from the neighboring one, but from the fact that outside the window, at 7.00 in the morning someone was breaking glass, or rather bottles, at 9.00 some repair work began, you could hear it as if it was next to you in a step. If you want to sleep well, then definitely not.
The downside is the old internet, it's more of a cheap decor, not cozy and comfortable.<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

The room is modern and clean, with a nice view on to a busy street. The location is perfect, with lots of bars/restaurants around and a short walk from all the wonderful sites Rome has to offer. Couldn't recommend enough!<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Cassandra Trappen; Rating: 1; When: a year ago <br> Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience with our room at all. For complete transparency, I rolled my ankle on the hotel steps upon arrival, which did contribute, but did not prevent us from leaving the room. This was no fault of the hotel.

We arrived after a wonderful three day stay in Amsterdam. The internet would not work which we brushed off initially as we were aware that internet can be spotty in Italy at times. We asked them to correct the issue as one of us had to touch base for work, but throughout our stay it was not consistent. Constantly cycling through on and off, an issue that could easily be fixed by purchasing a better router or calling the provider. This did not occur during our trip even though we contacted them multiple times to correct it. This meant the TV/Netflix was also no use to us and never worked. If you advertise free wifi in your hotel, follow through. If this issue is truly out of your control, disclose this on your website.

On our first night we both went to bed and turned on the AC unit. We immediately smelled mildew and mold coming from the unit, but were too tired to do anything about it. We both woke up with headaches, congestion and a terrible guttural cough. We had planned to go take a pizza cooking class that day but had to cancel due to this for no refund. We did get out of the room and started to feel better, but the second night went to sleep again and woke up feeling even worse. After we identified the reason we were ill, we started to notice the smell of mold in the hallway of the building as well. When we asked the caretaker about the mold, she exclaimed NO! as if we couldn’t possibly be correct. “I spray” she said as if this would take care of a mold issue. After emailing the front office we were given a separate room, but this unfortunately did not fix the issue. To put it bluntly, our stay in Rome was ruined because of this hotel. Multiple excursions were cancelled and a lot of money and time was wasted. Whenever we brought our issues to the caretaker she was rude and seemed annoyed. Positives were a comfortable bed and a refreshing shower which was our only escape from the mold.

I have never been this harassed in my life. Me and my husband booked this b &b months ago for 3 nights (12,13 and 14th June) via booking.com. The email they sent stated the check in time between 8:00 am to 1 pm on 12th June. Immediately after booking online (for which they took our credit card details) they charged the total amount for the 3 nights. This is unusual but because we were sure about this trip we were ok about it. I was supposed to fly in to Rome from Venice on 12th June morning but couldn't get tickets so I reached Rome at 8:30 pm. Let me make this very clear that I CALLED them on 10th June and E-MAILED them to inform them about my late arrival. Again I called after reaching Rome on 12th evening. Both times the same man on the phone informed me that late check-in on 12th June will not be possible and I should come in the next morning.It was inconvinient but I still agreed to that as payment had been done already. We spent the night at the Leonardo da Vinci airport then arrived just before 8:00 a.m on 13th June morning. The gate for the building was locked from inside. We pressed the bell and called the phone no. many times without any response. After the first ring they blocked my no.! I had called atleast a hundred times, sitting in the road in front of the hotel building for 4 hours without a clue about what going on! Can you imagine how we felt at the time? I tried calling from another no. and as soon as they realised it was me, they blocked that no.too! That is when I got scared. Two very kind local Italian people saw us sitting there for hours and decided to help us. They took us to the police station and tried to explain on our behalf our trouble. The Italian police don't understand english so that was a problem.. but this amazing policeman named Dominique was an absolute angel. He called the hotel no. and talked to them. The man (so conveniently picking up calls from the police but blocking our calls) just keeps saying to talk to booking.com and that they know nothing about anything. Dominique even called booking.com for us. That's when they said that apparently ABC hotels cancelled our resevation showing cause of NO SHOW. Now my question is I have already informed them before about being late. They have already charged me for 3 nights. Then they block calls and emails and without any warning just cancel our reservation?? What the hell is that all about? This is just complete fraudulance. I feel so helpless. I don't think I can even get back the money. Can anybody tell me what actions I can take against them?<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Leanne Jewell; Rating: 5; When: 3 years ago <br> Just spent 3 nights here...fantastic location...super friendly (Thank you Mario!!!)
