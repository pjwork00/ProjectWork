It is huge so I would recommend spending a day or two if you really wanna go through everything. wasn‚Äôt too crowded overall except around the Mona Lisa where it was a stampede. There is something for everyone here, it ranges in different time periods and art forms. It surpasses anything we have in Canada in terms of an art museum.They have cute gift shops all around which is convenient.

The Mona Lisa may be on your bucket list, but please do yourself a favor and see the rest of the museum. There are many paintings that are breathtaking that do not get the attention because of the ""Photo Op"" paintings. Contrary to what I read, I did not have to wait in a long line. The Louvre is very easy to get to by Metro and easy to navigate. I'm American and it was my first time in Paris.

The place is the most beautiful museum of the whole world and houses a great deal of artworks, paintings and monuments. It is a  real gem with lots of very high-end artworks. The quality of all sculptures is way too high as you can easily see and feel it. Mona Lisa is also in this museum. I was simply amazed at each and every part of this museum as it was full of history and has lots of very fine artworks around. It is very well organized and maintained and worth every penny. I would recommend to must visit it if you are going to Paris.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Marinko Zubac; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>The museum is amazing. We were the whole day in Louvre and still you have the impression that you could stay there forever. It's something you definitively should visit when in Paris.
Buy your tickets online so you don't have to wait in queues for the entrance.
The entrance to the museum is very simple. We waited for about 10 minutes to get through security. My suggestion is to get the Nintendo audio guide when visiting the Museum. It costs only 5 Eur and it helps a lot. The audio guide follows your location and helps to find around the museum. Its something like google maps for Louvre. When we were there Mona Lisa room was not too crowded so we had plenty of time to watch the painting. Do not search for souvenirs in the museum itself, you will have to go outside the museum in the direction of Metro station. There you will find the official Louvre Musem Shops.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Jenny Fall; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>3 weeks ago<br>Visiting the Louvre is an amazing experience that will stay with you forever. There is so much history and beauty to absorb and admire. The building itself is exquisite along with the beautiful painted ceilings. Then, there is of course all of the art. Winged Victory, Venus Di Milo, and the Mona Lisa are just a few of the world's most famous works of art that are permanently on display at the Louvre.<br><br>",TOUR

The left-hand obelisk remains in its location in Egypt, but the right-hand stone, 23 metres (75 ft) high, is now at the centre of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. The Luxor Obelisk in Paris was classified officially as a Monument historique in 1936; beneath it is the M√©tro station, Concorde. The obelisks are of yellow granite and inscribed with hieroglyphs in honour of the Pharaoh Ramesses II.
The 3,000-year-old obelisks were originally both situated outside of Luxor Temple. The Parisian example first arrived in Paris on 21 December 1833, having been shipped from Luxor via Alexandria and Cherbourg,[1] and three years later, on 25 October 1836, was moved to the centre of Place de la Concorde by King Louis-Phillipe. It had been given to France by Muhammad Ali Pasha, ruler of Ottoman Egypt in exchange for a French mechanical clock. After the Obelisk was taken, the mechanical clock provided in exchange was discovered to be faulty, having probably been damaged during transport. The clock still exists in a clock-tower at Cairo Citadel and is still not working<br><br><b>Author: </b>arghyadeep bhattacharyya; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 months ago<br>At the moment, the place has no crowd due to lockdown..but it is beautiful.
