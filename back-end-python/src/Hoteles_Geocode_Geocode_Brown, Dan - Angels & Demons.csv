 Nice aperitivo, we were a big group and they closed off an area for us.  The staff were very kind and helpful.

 Visited this restaurant at the recommendation of a tour guide in 2013, and the experience was unsatisfactory. The prices were high for the small amount and quality of food presented, the value of their introduction to olive oils was minimal; the waitress was rude, arrogant and combative. s. Our guide was ultimately able to extract a partial refund for us after a herculean battle with the apparently reborn spirit of the goddess Discordia. Several other diners in our group voiced the same concerns and complaints but our valiant guide had been gravely wounded from the battle on our behalf and in this weakened state was unable to prevail. We are visiting Rome again soon but will avoid Valle.

 My husband and I had dinner here on our 2nd night in Rome as we were staying right next door in Di Rienzo Pantheon Palace and the service was fine. On our 4th day we decided to have lunch and I requested for a sprite with ice as it was scorching hot in italy. I received the sprite but no ice. I kindly asked for it again, only to have the older lady with short curly hair to place the can of sprite on my hand and rudely told me 'see its cold' and walked off. My husband called over another waitress to request it again, to his dismay found the older waitress complaining aloud about our request. This is such a  disgusting display of customer service that we got up, paid for the drinks and left. We did complain to the manager who told us that the waitress was crazy.

 Unfortunately we are not there ...
The restaurant would like and perhaps could offer a lot but also because of the point where it is found that, even if very central it does not have an adequate tourist passage to be tried, it cannot give an adequate service. Big but always with a few tables occupied and this in my opinion affects the freshness and quality of the ingredients used. Friendly staff but all foreign decent dishes but nothing more prices even too low, in short I would not recommend it

 Well. In the center of Rome, a place where you can have decent lunch without spending a fortune. Buffet lunch is very convenient. They are also open in the evening but I went there only for lunch.

 Really nice intimate venue. Friendly staff and some class acts. Seats are 'compact' so if you're big/tall perhaps request a table or the front row. You must book, otherwise you won't get in. We paid €20 each and this includes a cocktail. The cocktails are really well made. Expect to pay around €11 for a drink.

 Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions.As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.
In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.

 Jazz Club with no Jazz.  We came here tonight and paid €20 entrance each expecting a night of jazz and dinner.  Instead we got some kind of jazz performers talking on a microphone all night assumably about jazz.....but no jazz. We don't speak Italian....but that wasn't the point.  We had dinner that was very average....very salty and nothing special.  So we spent €114 for.... nothing.  If you are a jazz club and you are not going to play any music please warn people before they come!!

 One of the best evenings I had in Rome!

Things started off slow, we registered to sing, got a little card and took some seats next to the wall.

The karaoke system is old school, and most of the songs are in italian--but there is a nice list of American songs as well.

We all toss the mic around from person to person, sing together, create makeshift duets. It was a magical experience, I felt like I was back in my old choir group.

The amount of joy in the atmosphere was amazing. I really felt like part of this little inclusive group of singers.

 Worst experience ever!
I wanted to celebrate my birthday there.
My expectation was a good party with nice people.
Instead i got a club looking like a cellar full of people who only wanted to hear old italian pop.
Very loud music.
Ordering cocktails was a real torture. The bar was empty but the waitress was not interested in serving. She looked very arrogant and miserable. Barely she managed to mix two over expensive 'sex on the beach'. The glass was filled up with ice as much as possible and the rest of space with something that had a taste of bitter orange juice and cheap alcohol.
A terrible mix of something.
Best thing came as they closed the club very early and all the people had to wait for their jackets in a small room.
To keep it short: never ever EVER again. Waste of money and time.

 Would not recommend going to this place if you are in Rome. Arrived around midnight, thinking this place would be starting up and instead was sent to the piano bar because the upstairs wasn't open yet. So we went to the empty piano bar, maybe three people in the whole bar. Decided to have a drink, when I asked for a menu they didn't have one, which I thought was pretty weird. Anywyas, bought two shots of tequila and it came out to 30€...so not worth it for that place.

 We were attracted here during Happy Hour, I asked which beers were in Happy Hour, it was two. But they did not told us it was only 0,4L, so we asked 1L and it was not in Happy Hour, and we only discovered that while we were paying (they omitted the information, although I specifically asked which beers were included in Happy Hour). Besides that, they charged us for 2L of the beer that costs 14 euros, but we asked 1L of the 14 euros beer and 1L of the 12 euros beer. They subtracted the 2 euros, but complaining until the very end.

 Located in a manner appropriate to its type as close to Piazza Venezia, the interiors furnished with a luxury that does not exaggerate making pleasant stay for the eyes. Service bar managed in an excellent way even in the evenings where there is the open bar, spinning smooth the evening to enjoy a good glass of wine. The quality of the buffet offered and the live music is also remarkable, as is the sudden change of the evening from a formal evening with live music at the disco around one in the night to cover a wider range of people.

 We went to this pub because we saw some marketing along the road, so I guess it really helps! The pub itself is big and has a very suited decoration setup. The small compartments are a nice feature, they devide the seating in a nice way. The waiters are really polite and helpful and respect social distancing. They have karaoke nights during the week, but unfortunately we weren't able to join. We can surely recommend a fresh pint of Guinness during the hot Italian days!

 If there is sport on this is where you want to be. There are screens everywhere and there is tons of comfy seating.

 Went shortly after it opened and stayed for an hour in hopes that the crowd would grow. Left because we realized that we were the only ones around as everyone left. 5$ cover charge isn't worth it. Music was hard to dance to and drinks were up to 20$; they also don't do any fancy shots. They also record your full name, birth date, and state you're from. Mandatory ID.

 Three room underground disco. 10 euros entrance that only includes bad alcohol, they asked for an  additional 7 euros for a good gin or whisky, total 17. €. They don't serve quality alcohol,  probably fake brands, be careful.

 Thought it was a club. It was not. Nice bar, but not worth 15 euros entry

 Many art forms, music, dance, theater... In Trastevere, maybe the last real Social-cultural place, now a days....

 Already left a review, it's a place of the heart ... But they don't just make jazz. It's all to discover.
