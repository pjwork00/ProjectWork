The show is in a smaller room upstairs where they cram quite a bit of people. Fortunately, they don’t let people smoke up there. Chairs are not very comfortable. Drinks are good and prices are 10-14€ per drink. Go before the live shows and happy hour downstairs is fun with cheaper drinks. Server was very friendly although a little slow since he was the only one upstairs attending to the live music room.
My wife and I had a great experience here but it was certainly due to the music. Go check it out! They seems to hire very talented artists!

Definitely a must go in the area.<br><br><b>Author: </b>David Henry; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Le Piano Vache is a dimly lit, rowdy rock ’n’ roll joint, its walls covered with concert posters and hundreds of old ID photos. It has a delightfully nostalgic feel, thanks to its furnishings which look like they haven’t been changed since the bar’s establishment in 1969. There are small tables along the bar, and a large space with a second bar and an old, out-of-tune piano sitting in the back.
Musically, every day here is different. Each Monday there is live manouche (French gypsy jazz); on other days the barman, or a DJ, focuses on 1980s music, gothic, punk, or rock. The bar is located in a small pedestrian street, just behind the Panthéon.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Shahin Amini; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>It's an institution, everybody's been there at some point in their lives, and you'll go there too, if not yet.

We took time researching several affordable Caberets around Paris and this place had great reviews. We viewed their website to which it had images of Caberet dancers in glamorous outfits doing all sorts. Where we arrived their we asked if there was Caberet to which the woman agreed and she told us it was a €20 price we would pay on the way out. We agreed and went in. When we arrived there was, to be fair, a sweet live band with good singers however after two hours we were waiting for the dancers/performers to come out. We went to question the host about when they’d be on to which she replied “we don’t do that anymore”, this obviously prompted an uncomfortable conversation as to why they were advertising Caberet when really it was just a live band and some karaoke. The woman began becoming confrontational begging us saying “plz be nice and just pay u didn’t even buy any drinks” (which were very expensive) we continued to argue the fact that their advertising was false and lured us in over false pretends to which she replied she’s not responsible for the websites mistakes. Clearly going nowhere  we gave up paid the amount and left even after offering to only pay half she was not having it and brought security down to intimidate us.

Menu: you can choose between two menus, meat or fish. We have taken the meat menu that today foresaw; foie gras appetizer with cooked pears and croutons, chicken in sauce with rice and sweet cheese and coffee. A glass of champagne as an aperitif and excellent Bordeaux wine. Rating 9

We booked a suit and I was expecting good things from this hotel, however I was very disappointed.

I prefer to take breakfast in the room as I like to do my make up and wake up a little before I see other people. But when we order breakfast we were told that we could only have bread and coffee in the room, some fruit and yogurt.

I normally like some eggs and make some meat and cheese but we were told this was not possible. So my husband had to arrange for the chef to make it for us as a one off service, which meant he had to go talk to the chef to arrange it as this was not offered by the hotel.

Also the coffee in the room was instant powder coffee, which is fine but not at the price we were paying, I wish I had brought my cafetière but I would of thought that in Paris France a decent coffee would of been one of the basics in a hotel room but sadly not.

However the room was fine, the bed and the staff were very nice and helpful. If you in Paris for business and you are not interested in having a good breakfast and good coffee this is the place for you. But if your like me and like a good breakfast and good coffee maybe this is not the place for you.

My advice to Management, the staff were great. The room as fine, but please offer room service and a good breakfast, I was very disappointed that you didn’t.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Alexandre Steiner; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>Clean and cosy but the rooms are small<br><br>",CLUB

The menu said pizza and frites but when we ordered they just said they only had cheese and jam plates! (Planches)

We waited more than half an hour to get the food. We ask her what was the problem, and the waitress answered ""the problem is that all people ask for the planches"" (of course if there is the only thing available hahahha )

Not to mention that there were no music and no good ""ambiance"" , reservation system totally inefficient, etc.

I wrote to complain, they said all waiters are new and need training and that they are changing the catering supplier. And that they have problems of organization between hotel clients and non clients!!

To redo absolutely<br><br><b>Author: </b>Marjorie L; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>No. The waiters refuse a glass of water. A GLASS OF WATER. They dared to give a friend a cup and told him to go use the toilet. We had been placed on benches following a reservation, then they come to move us because there would have been an error.

Ok. We were set up chairs when we were a group of 30. After asking for a gesture as compensation we ended up offering us a bottle of sparkling wine, whereas at the beginning we had been told to agree to a bottle of vodka . Supposedly the group was not consuming enough. Uh, a minimum blue card of 15th and 30 people who have only consumed cocktails that are not cheap. They could have found another excuse. So a bottle of sparkling wine for 30 people ?! Great, thank you.

If we weren't so many, we would have left, but we had all made the trip for an anniversary.

Avoid really!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Franck Aubree; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>Deplorable experience that I will not repeat: I booked by specifying that between 25 and 30 people were supposed to come on my birthday. With a monster nerve, a waitress shows me a poor little bench that can at best accommodate 7 people of average height, telling me that this will be more than enough, as a result, not being able to sit down, 2/3 of the guests stayed in front of the bar in prolonged cigarette exposure and have not consumed: well done.
Then, I ask to be served a glass of wine, while we were in the cellar, the waitress replies that there is no more wine, which her colleague confirms. I then ask if it is not possible to bring down wine from the bar above, the two waitresses answer me that it is impossible. I finally had to address myself to the lady at the reception, much more helpful, friendly, and professional than her two colleagues in the cellar, who agreed to bring down bottles of wine.
In addition, one of my guests ordered Nachos (not the most complicated dish, you will admit), which she only had herself served after an hour and after having insisted on several times. serve the dish she had paid for.
Finally, and this was the coup de grace, after drinking a shot, a friend started having a cough, and therefore asked for a glass of water (a common glass of tap water !!!), which the waitresses refused her, telling her that if she wanted to stop coughing she only had to buy a bottle of water ...
These two waitresses who took care of the bar in the cellar, not content to be professionally dismayed (one of them was unable to open a bottle of wine ...), also showed incredible disdain with my friends and myself. It's a shame, because until I ran into these two waitresses this place was lovely. Now I will not be going back.<br><br>",CLUB
