 I'm a Marriott platinum member i still keep a bad memory about his hotel i visited in 2014 with my 4 sisters who came to visit Paris for the first time, they booked a suit and once in this hotel they got a small room with 1 Bed for all of them, imagine 4 people in 1 bed.
The tiny room was a part of a suit in which other clients were, they heard everything that happened in the other side and the next day when i visited them i heard everything too.

The 2nd bad thing i remember is the housekeeper who came at 11 to kick all of us because she was late for launch, i called the reception and told me they will ask her to leave, they called but after 10 min she came back and she was speaking french  with her colleague thinking i was a tourist but i replied her in French and she left the room after spending 5 min  in the bathroom and declared she cleaned it.

Whatever since that day on April 2014 i did not visit this hotel anymore.

It sad because i'm a Loyal member to Marriott and i receive emails about this hotel but i never reply.

If the manager see my review i want him to know that i still keep in mind this memory and i'm not ready to go back to this hotel.

 excellent service from arrival to departure. The reception staff was very knowledgeable about places to go and things to do. The rooms met all standards and the hotel itself was very comfortable. Visited here to experience Christmas in Paris and was not let down one bit. It is ideally located in the heart of everything, walking distance to many attractions and food places.

 Lobby is beautiful, staff at the front desk are very polite and kind - However!

Booked a high floor terrace room with king based off of the Marriott app images. Ended up getting a view of an alley, and construction. Absolutely terrible view - room was on par with the holiday inn. Sink wouldn‚Äôt drain, bathroom was very old and paint chipping, minibar fridge was warm.

Room service delivered the wrong food, and the gym was absolutely tiny! The entrance to the gym has a pull up bar so if anyone is using it you have to wait to enter. The limited machines are all from the mid 90s, and half the treadmills were out of service. No fans, no airflow, no strength training equipment aside from a basic set of dumbbells.

 We stayed at the Sofitel Paris le Faubourg for a night and we spent an incredible time. The room was gorgeous, the staff was very nice and accommodating, and despite the Covid restrictions it was very easy and quick to get meals in the room. The food was excellent!
The location could not be any better, the building is beautiful, the staff is very friendly... There's no better place to stay at in Paris!

 This hotel is a true gem in the hustle and bustle of Paris.  Tucked away in a sidestreet to Rue du Faubourg Honor√©, next to Herm√©s, the hotel leaves nothing to desire for.
The staff is friendly yet relaxed and takes best care of you.
The Concierge made it possible to get me tables in usually unavailable restaurants.
The breakfast team is attentive - just to the right point.
And the reception made it possible to arrange our room early - because we arrived fairly early.
A relaxed yet elegant Parisien atmosphere, makes it a true home away from home.
I sure will be back.  Thank you Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg.

 The hotel was lovely, very comfortable, great location...
But like anything ...service is everything. The service was excellent! The front desk reception, specifically Perine, a young lady from Provence; just made us feel so very welcome!

 The room was quite small, but adequate and always very clean.  Most of my time was spent touring Paris and it's surrounding areas.  I believe there has been major remodeling since my stay (October 2010).  I am not sure the room on the first floor in which I stayed (to the right of the entrance) remains the same.  It was a beautiful hotel in a lovely area of Paris.  The Staff were all very pleasant and helpful.

 I decided to change my review and downgrade another star because if the arrogance if the staff. This hotel is run by indians who think they can apply their cultural heritage to Europe. Dirtiness bad service etc. For the money paid you could stay elsewhere and get more . There is no excuse why a room stinks of drainage upon checking there is no excuse for saying someone called all those are lies and fake excuses for someone who failed badly. When you are in hotel services the client comes first and if the client complains you listen. It says it all that they don't even bother to ask at chcekout if stay was ok or not they don't care all they care is to get money and goodbye

 Quirky little hotel, with a small lift. Rooms are more than adequate.

 I have to leave a review because my family had such a pleasant stay in this hotel. From the moment we got out of our car service, we were greeted by a super friendly staff who helped us with our luggage. The front desk agents were super nice, helpful and always with a smile.As soon as we got to our room - it was immaculately clean and perfect. We're thinking of coming back in November and we will definitely stay here again. It's close to everywhere we wanted to go. Thank you so much Hotel Mayfair!!

 The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give the Mayfair a 5 star rating is because it is very noisy. Around 4:00am there was loud construction noises or the sounds of people moving furniture. It prevented sleep after 4am both nights i was there. Other than that great  spacious rooms and amazing staff.

 It is one of the best hotels in entire Paris area. I have visited Paris once or twice a year for more than 15 years. And I stayed 4 nights here at hotel Mayfair.
Among the similar price range, I‚Äôve never seen any hotel that is better than this one.
People were very nice, the room was absolutely clean and quiet. Also the location was just amazing. Located in very Safe area and comfortable to get public transportations ex)metro, bus, taxi.
Also close to shopping area, such as rue saint honore.
Definitely one of the best hotels in Paris and I would visit again

 This hotel is amazing. Next to the interior and design, the crew is professional, hospitable, friendly and makes you feel at home.

From the moment of arrival to departure, it was a joy.

The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. The design is outstanding.

Bathrooms are a a treat and I appreciated the seperate toilet.

Even midst Covid, this hotel and its crew made
a solid effort to ensure their guests had a good time.

Highly recommended and will for sure stay again.

 Highly recommend this hotel to any US traveler. Hands down the winner, with its detailed room design(a bit weird light switches but thats ok) and terrific personnel. Breakfast was top quality; this hotel deserves its price. Location is great, if they put you in a room where you can be disturbed by the ongoing renovation, ask to be replaced in a quieter room. I would love to stay again on September if I could get the same price.

 My door card didn‚Äôt work and I replaced it twice a day i stayed here.  I asked them to replace it and had to go downstairs every day I stayed at this hotel. The last two days of my trip I received a new card for my room twice. One in the morning, one at night. The staff would apologize and wouldn‚Äôt do anything to solve the main problem.

It‚Äôs frustrating to go up and down to find out that I can‚Äôt get into the room.

The room service left my room door open after cleaning it our second day. The heat would barely work and I would come back to my room finding the window wide open.

It‚Äôs 40 degrees out. I stayed here 6 days and I checked out leaving sick.

 We spent two nights at the Westin Vendome for our New Years trip to Paris.  We were beyond excited to be in the city of love! Upon arrival at the Westin we were told the room wasn‚Äôt ready although we were there at the scheduled check in time of 3pm.

The front desk staff did everything they could do to find us a room that was cleaned and ready but as Titanium Elite members we had already been upgraded to the largest room in our room category they had available.  We were obviously ready to hit the ground running and get out into the city but we were requested to wait until our room was ready.  However that time was undetermined so we were given a courtesy drink at the bar for each of us. While they held our luggage we made our way to the bar where we were delightfully surprised at the ambiance and friendly staff.  Plus the drinks were delicious!  We thought it was an amazing start to our few days in Paris as we sat enjoying our cocktails and snacks. After an hour our room was still not ready and the staff comped another round of drinks for us. Although it was frustrating not to be able to get in and clean up after arriving from the long trip and embarking on the city but we really enjoyed the relaxed start to the weekend and were thankful for the time at the bar.
Once we got checked into our room we were able to get to the streets of Paris!  We made it back to our room later that night to find a bottle of champagne and chocolate provided on the house!    We were recently engaged and couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased at the service the Westin was providing. Excellent touch!  The following evening we were upgraded to a suite which exceeded out expectation! It was HUGE!  We had two balconies which gave us a view of the Tuileries garden.  We thoroughly enjoyed the extra space especially the sitting room area.  Lastly of note was the breakfast, which was comprised of a full buffet including everything from pastries & coffees to made to order eggs.  We enjoyed this every morning as a perfect start to our day.  We would highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Paris - great location, excellent amenities & incredible staff.

 The hotel is excellent and priced fairly for what it is. The breakfast is a bit over priced since it seems to be boxed eggs and sausage as the only hot items.

 It seems they have closed, perhaps permanently.

6th time back to St. James & Albany. Over past 20 years it's been refurbished quit a bit. Mostly good smart changes. One of the few hotels with a grand piano available, although currently lacking a bench. I've heard guests playing Chopin & Rachmaninov pretty well here. Fairly good breakfasts, good bar after 4 PM. On warm days try meals in their courtyard. Very clean, but still showing signs of wear and age. Rooms on courtyards are very quiet. One of the best locations in all of Paris right on Rue de Rivoli across from the Tuileries. Walk to metro station across street. Multiple great restaurants within 5-10 minute walk. Very nice staff.

Shower cabin barely fit one person, toilet paper was same quality as public toilet.

The Doors to the hotel were locked at weird times a day, several times we had to wait minutes for an employee to let us in or out, despite ringing the bell multiple times.

I loved the decor in the hotel, modern, artsy and a little industrial. The breakfast is continental and could be improved, not a great selection of fruit and cereals. Overall a lovely stay, will definitely be returning

 Very nice hotel located at very good area. Metro station ( Europe) is just 3 mins walk. Rooms little small but very clean and have a balcony from rue du Constantinople side, the breakfast good enough and the stuff perfect. Close to the hotel (40 m.) there is a market, 12' - 15' mins walking is opera area and Lafayette, 20'-25' mins walking Montmartre area. I suggest definitely this hotel, especially for a couples or companionships

 Worst ibis service in the chain!

At check-in I was un-welcomed by un a happy grampy person making the process slow and uncomfortable. When I complained another colleague jump in. But if course not to ease the process for the customer but to defend the indefensible behavior of his colleague!

I left very early this morning and I am still waiting for the invoice, someone to pick up the phone or respond my email.

I have spent over 100 nights in ibis hotels in many major European cities, of course in France the services is usually much lower than the rest of the world, but is usually surprisingly friendly for parisian standards. In this particular facility you will find the lower standard poor parisian service...

 I stayed here 7 nights including Christmas day last year.

Overall: Best hotel in this price range.
All staffs did Great Service and daily room cleaning.
Easy to see Eiffel tower whenever I want.
Easy to go big grocery store, nice restaurant, bar, and bakery  within 2 minute walk.

One thing tourist could feel inconvenience would be little far distance between hotel and subway station, but this is not a big deal.

I would visit again, if I have a chance to go Paris.

 Great little hotel! Little being the key word. Typical of Paris, and many big city hotels, the rooms are small, but very comfortable. The price is very reasonable, especially considering the location. Many cafes, bakeries and shops are within minutes walking, and the Eiffel Tower is a leisurely 10 minute stroll. The staff is friendly and accommodating. While we didn't take part in the daily wine and cheese, it looked to be tasty and a great way to relax before seeing the evening sights in Paris. I highly recommend this place!

 We‚Äôve stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The first night we went to dinner and 40 minutes later when we come back we realized that someone has enter to our room and stole our things. The hotel didn‚Äôt take the responsibility of this action blaming on us. The first reaction of reception was to sent an mail to the director of the hotel. They even didn‚Äôt call to the person in charge! After a long time we finally could speak with the director. We first asked for the security camera and the answer  was ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have but we want to install them‚Äù. Then I asked for the door registration and also they don‚Äôt have any. Finally after demanding responsibility, the director told us that we hadn‚Äôt any evidence to prove that someone have stole us.

The total amount that we have been stolen was 450‚Ç¨ more electronic devices estimated in 200‚Ç¨. We have put a complain to the police station and they were freaking out .

After all we have tried to be in contact with the hotel and they don‚Äôt answer us!!!

The worst experience in my hole life!

 Little hotel very close, within walking distance to Eiffel Tower. Everything is very clean and neat with a great attention to details. The rooms are very small, and the bathroom is really tiny. The sink is super tiny like a foot wide, 8"" deep and the shower fits only one person, you can barely rotate, or bend over to reach the dropped soap. The rooms have AC, some face the interior court, they have flowers hanging by the window sill. Very nice. No room refrigerator, however,  you have a safe to keep your valuables in it. The hotel has an elevator, super tiny for two (skinny) people or one person and one luggage. The stairs are in a spiral, you have to be careful when you go down or when you exit the elevator. All in all was a very nice hotel and will stay again when we visit Paris.

 Fantastic location, amazing view from the Eiffel Tower suite but totally lacking in the fine touches and feels like they do the bare minimum but nothing more. The room was nice but furniture needs updating and the bathrooms whilst functional need updating too.

Nice and firm bed and pillows and comfortable. Supplies in the room like coffee etc was bare minimum and if you wanted more than one cup of coffee or tea during the day you had to call down to reception as there was only one tea bag and two pouches of instant coffee in the room.

Value for money is lacking here compared to amenities offered in room, at similar establishments in the city. Staff are very nice and polite and helpful when needed.

 NOT a 5 Star hotel. Yes the lobby is breathtaking. It's very beautiful,  and centrally located... and they have delicious chocolate cake that room service can bring.Who cares if it was featured in The Bourne Identity. Matt Damon isn't here. The floors in our room were stained with something dark and mysterious.  The refrigerator didn't work and smelled like human organs were stored in there at one point. The scratched-up clothing iron looked as if it had been stolen from a pauper's estate sale. Two words for the bathroom crew: grout cleaner. The lock on the door was insufficient, the room overlooked a gravel deck of nothingness... but you could walk right over to the Louvre in about 5 minutes. And that's pretty snappy, and well worth  your sheckels.

Save for the first day‚Äôs breakfast at the restaurant which was unusually crowded and was therefore a factor in a drop in service standards,  we were met with excellent service generally the other two mornings of our stay.  The hotel room we stayed in (which was a suite) was very good and we were impressed by what was achieved in a relatively small space - the bathroom was fantastic!

 We booked a 4 night stay at this hotel during the pandemic travelling from Canada. We were very nervous about travelling but the hotel seemed to have many procedures in place. When we arrived, we inquired about having our clothes cleaned right away after travelling for 12 hours. We were told that no one would be in the room 24-48 hours prior to us arriving. We checked in and went to our room only to see a man leaving our room. We entered and saw some decorations and complimentary champagne as we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary. This was a nice gesture but made us feel very uncomfortable as we were told the room is untouched for 1-2 days prior. With the increase in cases why was this allowed and why weren‚Äôt we informed. Balloons were blown up and placed on the bed, with a room so small and items placed all over we felt very uncomfortable. We quickly showered, changed and brought our clothes down to be dry cleaned. We left for a walk to ease our fears and anxiety, however, it got worse at that point. We called the hotel to let them know we felt uncomfortable and had to leave we were told this would be okay. So we booked the Westin across the street after asking them about the procedure for the room actually being empty before a guest arrives. This felt much cleaner and safer. We got our luggage and retracted our clothes from from desk and checked out. To our surprise we were charged $700 for a 2 hour stay. This so unacceptable. Especially since we booked another hotel from the same company and were in and out within hours. Only leaving because of this hotel not feeling safe and following the rules.
When we spoke to Morgane she was willing to give us points which does not even cover one nights stay. This is awful and by no means fair for what we went through. Steer clear of this hotel. Customer service won‚Äôt help they ask you to deal with the hotel directly and they don‚Äôt help or follow rules, of not during a pandemic imagine during regular and busy season without.

 We've stayed at Hotel West End twice.  Before our first visit, we assumed we would stay there one time and stay at one of the other hundreds of hotels in Paris on a future visit.  Nope. We'll never stay anywhere else.  The property is beautiful and cozy. The size means the staff gets to know every guest and the service is exceptional.  (This starts before you even arrive with offers of assistance with reservations, transfers, etc.)  We've been fortunate enough to have Eiffel Tower views on both our stays but I don't believe there is a bad room in the hotel.  They're all well appointed and well maintained.  The in-room breakfast is my idea of heaven.  And the location is ideal for those who want easy access to key sites as well as several Metro stops without being right on the Champs. We're already plotting our next trip!

Also don't like the fact that the toilet is so far away from the rest of the bathroom but maybe that was the floor plan if just my room.  Either way it was a good experience staying here.

Update 11/21/19 :  So at checkout they said they will email me final invoice.  Been two weeks no email and I even emailed them to send me invoice and no reply!  Not just this they charged my card in two amounts which adds to the correct total but from an expensing point of view caused so much headache.  Why would you break the total I to two separate random amounts and then charge the card.  I am inclined to take away a star for poor invoicing and post departure service.

 I'm extremely disappointed at the lack of customer service at this 5 star hotel, L'Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe. Although I understand that this hotel has been experiencing difficulties due to the pandemic, it is absurd that there has been no effort from the hotel in contacting me for my refund request that I made back in April 2020. I'm constantly attempting to contact them but haven't heard anything. I am facing difficulties of my own during this pandemic. For a 5 star hotel, you would think they are more understanding and actually care for their guests. Unacceptable!

 While I have every sympathy with the dilemmas hotels must be facing during the pandemic, the attitude that the Five Star Hotel du Collectionneur has exhibited with regard to customer service and refunds is, well, relaxed at best.

When ringing the hotel to enquire about a refund, I was told to ""be patient"" and to email the hotel with my request. Email written back in June, which elicited a generic response which did not mention refunds in any capacity but assured that ""we will keep you updated through this dynamic situation"".

And so to August, no updates received. Phoned hotel - repeat of previous paragraph. ""Be patient"". Sent email again. No response at all this time.

The hotel was efficient in the collection of our money some months ago. All in all, most unsatisfactory.

 Get away from that hotel. They are not honest.They have taken 100euros on my cr√©dit card after my stay because they have accused me to smoke in the bedroom. I ve never smoked cigaret in my all life! Also on the first day of my booking they wanted to send me to an other h√¥tel next door, less confortable with bad d√©coration. Also the booking price on internet was 20e less expensive than booking price at the desk. Get away!

 Bed was ok and comfy other than the fact its 2 singles pushed together. They never restocked on the shower gels or shampoo...  basic interior design.

 Breakfast wasn't amazing, but the room, and service more than made up for it.

To those thinking about staying here, just a heads-up that this is very close to the president's /politician buildings (we were unaware), so you will need to answer to military personnel when you want to enter the street. The room is 10 metres away from the entrance point which makes it easier. Not a bad thing, just something to keep in mind.

Very safe and secure.

Would come back in a heartbeat.

 Planned our trip to Paris before Covid-19 took over, booked our flight and our stay in that hotel. We planned to visit France in the end of April 2020, but as France was in lockdown we could reach there. Asked for refund as the cancellation is not our fault, they proposed to save the money until February 2021. As the new lockdown came through and we still can‚Äôt travel ti France I kindly asked to refund my booking, and they never aswered. Very poor communication and poor experience. Whenever the world will be stable again, we will take our trip to Paris, but we will avoid this hotel due to really bad communication and not aswering any calls or e-mails.

Breakfast needs to increase the types of foods and to give a choice to take breakfast from the kitchen (like Omelet with something different for me like only tomato and cheese or only onion, currently that‚Äôs not available in this hotel.
For me I care about breakfast a lot, cause I‚Äôm tourist I‚Äôve a lot to do from the beginning of the day -_^

 Our experience in this hotel was awful. First of all we had interiour courtyard views as you can see in the picture, we were in Paris for just two days and having views to the boiler room was pretty annoying. Moreover, the air conditioner was not working properly the first day. It was 40 degrees in Paris and eventhough they knew that in this room the air conditioner was not working well, they gave it to us.
To end, they didn‚Äôt clean our room one day.  We were out during all the morning, we came back to the hotel at 15:00 in order to rest a bit. The room was not done yet, when we finished resting they told us that they no longer could do our room because the cleaning ladies had to leave. They have had all morning to do it!!

 Do not stay here.  Room was dirty, worn and the bathroom had mold.  Staff was rude. Breakfast opened 30 minutes late, only had one person working and was missing many options including water and coffee.  When I checked in I was told that breakfast was included.  Upon checkout they attempted to charge me for breakfast.  I ended up arguing with the receptionist as if I would have known it was not included I would have not eaten in a restaurant that was so poorly run. Overall a very bad experience.  I would not recommend this hotel at all.

 We have stayed in this hotel for more than a handful of times, and have always enjoyed the stay here. However, I am giving it a 1 star as I have been put into an extremely stressful situation by this hotel.
The french national strike caused my train to Paris to be cancelled, so we have contacted the hotel to cancel the booking, as there will be no chance that we can make it to Paris. Instead of responding to the enquiry professionally, they replied in an extremely rude manner and insisted on charging the first night. We understand that there is a cancellation policy so we have offered to rebook the rooms for another date, but they have only ignored my requests completely. Given this experience, I would suggest to avoid this hotel at all cost as their staff do not behave like they are working for a 5-star hotel at all.

 Looks nice from the exterior and entry, but the rest of the hotel is run down. The elevators are old and rickety. My bathroom had mismatched tile, mold in the shower and the wood of the vanity had water damage which it's appearance was made worse by many bad attempts at a repair.  The room was stark which is part of their design but it seems very dated. The style reminds me of a NY Soho loft 20 years ago, although they say  it was recently remodeled. The bed was comfortable but they had a mattress protector that was like sleeping on a garbage bag. The location is great!

Free nonalcoholic drinks refreshed daily in the mini fridge with a great selection of free movies. There was plenty of tea, coffee, and Nespresso options.

The bar staff, cocktails, and food was great! We went twice during our 2 night stay.

The only issue we had was with the shower / bathtub itself. The water pressure was great, but because there was no door, water got everywhere. Not the end of the world.

We were celebrating our daughter‚Äôs college graduation and my son, daughter and I stayed in a beautiful Gallery Suite. We were warmly welcomed and efficiently introduced to the property and settled into our suite after our 8 hour flight. Our suite was perfect for 3 adults- I wanted that sweet ‚Äúhangout time‚Äù with my children and the dressing room/closet, large bathing room and separate bathroom gave us all of the privacy and functionality we needed. We dined at the Bar Long the first night-lively, fun  people watching, great food and cocktails in a beautiful space, and then again at Matsuhisa before we left- again excellent Japanese dishes with a Peruvian twist, a very nice crowd and excellent knowledgeable service- high praise from someone who lived in Tokyo and entertained clients there!
My adult children ages 21 and 19 loved the Philippe Starck design and the modern touches that were beautifully executed- all of our electronics cords were carefully wrapped in signature Royal Hotel Monceau Velcro straps by amazing housekeeping when we returned from our first day on the town, we received great advice from Megalie at the Concierge desk about tickets to the French Open and she found a rare pair of Vejas shoes for my daughter, and Melanie at the Reception set a happy and welcoming tone for our entire weeklong stay- the quality and attention never wavered.

The bathroom had been remodeled. It too was very clean and had no mold or untidiness to it. They had upgraded the lighting system to less. This was nice.
Breakfast was served on floor ‚Äú1‚Äù. Very small room, but very nice breakfast. Plenty to eat.
I recommend the Waldorf very highly. It has history going back before WWI.

 This is the worst hotel I have stayed in. The location is the only good thing about this place.
We were directed to this hotel by the tour company we used. If we were to choose it as an individual, we would definitely not choose this hotel.

First, the room has a musty smell. From the moment I walked in, I smelled moldy and had a headache for a while.
The walls of the room are thin and I can hear the person next to me talking.
The bathroom is very small and there are no shelves. There isn't even a shower curtain in the bathtub, so we have to sit in the tub and take a shower.
There wasn't much cleaning done, and there was a lot of dust around the washbasin and toilet.

The breakfast is also terrible.
We went to the dining room early that day because we had to leave the hotel early in the morning, but there was no staff. But the bread was already there, and when I went to pick it up, a large number of flies flew out of the bread. I was very shocked to find that the bread had been left unpeeled all along.
There are too many other bad points to write about. All I can say is that you should not stay at this hotel.

 To whom ever considers booking a room in his hotel, please take into consideration that they indeed take your money just to secure your place. But unfortunately when at the lobby they inform you that no money was taken form your credit card but netherless they give you a piece a paper to guarantee you a refund even tho you re-pay once there. Days passed by and no refund has been made. My friend experienced the same problem. They are scammers

 Clean, comfortable and charming! The location was prime. Close to great restaurants and shopping. Busy street, but quiet room. The staff was warm, welcoming and super helpful. Ritz Carlton style customer service. We arrived very early for our check-in and they went out of their way to get our room ready. They held onto our luggage for the day after we checked out and went on an excursion. The hotel itself could use a little refreshing to match the quality of service. The room was lovely, but could use some updating. That said, it was very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was $16 dollars additional. We chose to eat out. The great things outweighed the not so perfect. I would gladly book again on my next trip, knowing we could count on the friendly faces to greet us.

 I actually didn‚Äôt stay at the hotel. I had a booking and on medical advice related my pregnancy, needed to cancel. I informed the hotel by phone a couple of hours after the cancellation window of the extraordinary circumstances and received an unapologetic response from the manager four days later simply stating they would nonetheless be charging the full costs.

 Alright where do I start? It‚Äôs a nice cozy hotel tucked away in the streets of Paris but not to far from the big tourist attractions. English speakers within the hotel were easy to find. There is a supermarket two minutes away from the hotel which is a plus. Ok now to the hotel itself, the rooms were pretty small but in Paris most hotel rooms are tiny. We paid for the breakfast downstairs which had a mediocre selection. When we get shown to our room and look around, we see brown stains all over. All over the walls, floor and ceiling. Disgusting! We were given attitude when we asked to switch rooms. We tried the hotel 10 years ago and the hotel was fabulous. In 2019 it was pretty horrendous shouldn‚Äôt establishments improve over time?

We stayed here during our food tour to Paris at Pierre Gagnaire before flying to Copenhagen for our dinner reservations at Noma and Geranium.
This Park Hyatt location is super, walking distance to many luxury shops and great restaurants and museums.  Although I missed my reservation at Pierre Gagnaire because I got separate from my sister. I ended up went to the hotel and had dinner nearby, and stopped at Restaurant Le Meurice Alain Ducasse for a cocktail before walking back to the Park Hyatt.

 If you can afford it - this is a great place to stay in Paris. Close to all the tourist destinations. Great rooms with functioning AC and decent shower pressure. Many celebrity stays here so you will see fans waiting at the front/back entrance every now and then.

It‚Äôs also an easy walk to most of the major sites and metro.  We didn‚Äôt opt for the breakfast (rather just walked down the street for a great pastry for 1‚Ç¨) but it smelled amazing.

 Hotel is ""closed indefinitely"" yet will not refund room deposit for a May reservation and instead has offered a voucher to rebook within 12 months.
For starters, they are closed indefinitely, so that 12 month window could be as little as a couple months. Secondly, I live in Canada, I'm not just rescheduling a trip to Paris when they say that they are Now Open For Business.
I understand that the Covid-19 situation has us all in a bad place but stealing people's money is not the answer.

It's completely unacceptable that the hotel took bookings while it was closed and diverted me to another hotel without advance notice and giving me the choice whether I still wanted to book in that hotel (considering it was cheaper also). The hotel we were directed to (ATN hotel) is a hotel I previously saw and did NOT want to stay in. And the worst is that upon arrival to the ATN hotel, the guy at front desk had the nerve to tell me that if I don‚Äôt like the hotel I can cancel and go elsewhere! That‚Äôs not something you say to a guest who arrives at 3pm and doesn‚Äôt have time to look for a new alternative!

 I have been to many hotels in Paris and I can easily say that Francois 1er is one of my best stays so far. For first-time visitors to Paris, it has the best location: it's very close to the metro station Georges V and a few steps away from the famous busy Champs-Elysees. (Yet the hotel street was very calm, good for sleep and rest.)

The lobby interiors are very cozy, French chic, as well as the rooms. I especially liked the marble bathroom with a large bathtub. The service is quite attentive and hospitable, where they serve you every day with chocolate treats and water bottles. I guess the owner is Lebanese, which may explain the many Arab clientele that stayed at the hotel.

As for the breakfast, it is a little restraint, but it has all that you basically need.

The only remark I would have is that the soundproofing is really bad. I could literally know which channel they were watching in the other room. At 1:00 am I even heard the alarm and luggage noises. It may be standard to have the same problem in other Parisian hotels, but here I felt it was paper-thin.
But this detail stays minor comparing to all the other positive things about Francois 1er.

 Our family stayed at the Hotel Richepanse for a week in the summer of 2017 and greatly enjoyed our stay.

First, this isn't an American style hotel with gift shops, restaurants, etc. If that's what you want there are plenty to choose from but they'll set you back about 50% more and the service won't be nearly as good.

The rooms were large, clean, well appointed and great for the few times we wanted to just hang out and rest. We had a corner room on the top floor and the view from the small patio was fun at breakfast for people watching as folks came and went.

The location is very convenient. You're walking distance to many popular attractions and public transit.

We're avid travelers and have stayed in LOTS of hotels and we'd stay here again anytime!

 Great location. Minimal services and cafeteria was closed due to covid. No bar connected to the hotel but in the same building. We took a suite and it was very well appointed. In room breakfast was great. House keeping services were really nice and the toiletries were provided by Dyptique which was a nice treat. Reception was clean and friendly and enough space to Lounge or wait for a taxi. We chose the hotel for location and size of the room and were not displeased.

 It was my first time sleeping in Paris with my family. We stayed four nights at this hotel in a one bedroom suite and was very comfortable and impressed with the service. Upon arrival there was candy and a teddy bear welcoming the kids and chocolate on the bed. The couch opened up into two twin size beds which was perfect for our kids.

There was plenty of closet and drawer space.

The toilet bathroom and the fridge was on the smaller size, but that‚Äôs typical in Europe and all hotels unless you stay in an apartment.

The breakfast was slightly above average compared to typical American continental, but nothing that will blow your mind.

However, what stood out to most during our stay was the extreme hospitality of the manager and front desk staff. The manager greeted us at our car upon arrival and the staff went above and beyond and were so genuinely friendly. They were so sweet to our kids as well and even gave them a cute Paris coloring book journal which they enjoyed working on during the train to London.

The location is minutes walking from top attractions and eateries. If we come back I would definitely stay again.

 Still impress this hotel till today...
I had been stay 28 nights on March this year. Excellent location near by Opera and lots of restaurant.  Easy to go everywhere by Metro or Bus.  Super friendly and helpful staff. Good facility.  If I plan to go Paris again.  This hotel will be only choice for me .

 Terrible experience at this hotel. My wife and I stayed here for 1 night during a recent trip to Paris and would not recommend this place to anyone. First, my pregnant wife was fighting a bad cold while we were there so I asked for a couple extra tea bags. The guy working the desk refused and informed us the 2 ‚Äòcomplementary‚Äô ones left in the room were all they could provide. After asking a second time he begrudgingly offered 1 tea bag. Honestly, how much do tea bags cost? Clearly my wife was sick and we only asked for a couple more... quite ridiculous in my opinion.

Second, upon check out we were asked how many of the water bottles in the room were used. After explaining we used all three (small) bottles of water, we were informed that only 1 was complementary and that we had to pay 3.80 euro each for the other two (apparently the cost of water is equivalent to gold). We said that wasn‚Äôt clear to us as nowhere did it mention there would be a cost. We were told this information is in the guestbook... I guess we needed to read the guest book before touching or using anything in the room. I‚Äôm surprised I wasn‚Äôt charged for using the bathroom.

Third, the bed and pillows in the room were absolutely brutal. Extremely soft and saggy mattress which needs to be replaced. Pillows were lumpy and not comfortable at all.

Next, our entire floor smelled like a sewage pipe had burst. This smell also filled the elevator which made for a less than pleasant ride each time. The smell got worse during the short period of time we were there.

Finally, the front of the hotel blasts a bright purple light all night long. If you have a front facing room like we did, you‚Äôll see the light in your room all night since the curtains essentially did nothing to block the light.

Overall this was a horrible experience and I would not recommend this place to anyone.

 The hotel rooms was nice. Accessible and walking distance to the metro and eiffel tower. Very convenient to the city. Most hotel staff was courteous and respectful. One man however, was a little grumpy.

The room has an awful smell when we arrived. We were transfered to another room, but it was the same. I discovered that the curtains was causing the smell. The smell was like a human odor who did not take a bath for days. Awful! We stayed there for 3 nights. It was bearable to some like my wife, but I won't recommend it to someone who has a sensitive nose like me. I hope the hotel can improve on this. I could have given 5 stars easily.

 The only nice thing of this hotel is location. The stay is not nice because:
1. Me and my wife stay here for two nights, and only ONE bottle of water for the FIRST night is free! We have to go to grocery store for water ourselves. Just because we stayed more than one night, we are not qualified for water the following day?
2. We had a leaking kettle at the first place.  The second night when we came back, the kettle was replaced with a dirty and smelly one. When we ask for changing to a normal one, the reception guy said no one is available and refused to exchange the one with us in front desk, which I suspect belongs to us because it is the same brand and also leaking. What he suggested was ‚Äúevery time you need hot water, just come down and I can do it for you here‚Äù. I suspect there is no solution better than that, Huh?
They have no passion and not care about how to improve their service. Not deserve the price at all.

 Really disappointed with how unprofessional this establishment is!
I made a booking for my graduation which I couldn‚Äôt attend because government deciding to put a lock down on everything.. despite the unfair conditions placed on me I still had to pay for my one night room due to late 48hrs cancellation on a global issue mind you! And a delay in communication by government.
Public services is about how you treat humans in times of crisis wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone ..:

 Pathetic hotel run by a bunch of robbers. Lockers are broken. Rooms were too small with no space to even open our luggage bags. We left our baggage only during breakfast time for about 30mins and our money went missing. Please do not make the mistake of booking this property.

 It is not a non smoking hotel, and pay attention, there are NO air conditioners. Rooms face the courtyard and people are allowed to sit there and smoke.  My room filled with the smoke. It is over 90 degrees in Paris and I must keep my window closed because of the smoke. The fan in the room doesn‚Äôt work. The bathroom smells of urine from the moment we checked in. The sink is not draining. The front desk responded with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. Very dated and carpet is filthy, as you can tell by clean white socks worn in room that turn brown/black. Staircase between floors is spiral and painted concrete, making it very unsafe. Slow elevator fits two people and one piece of luggage. I‚Äôm not sure when the pictures posted were taken on the website, but they are not a true representation.

 Location was great (in the Opera District)... facility was dated with an antiquated and dangerous electrical system...we paid for a studio large and got a standard studio which was cramped...the description of the room in our reservation documents did not match the room we got..hotel management insisted we were in a large studio...this was clearly bait and switch and every room description indicates we were assigned a standard studio...instead of a sofa bed we got a cot...my rating went from a 1 to a 2 because the hotel staff finally recognized there was an electrical problem in our room where the fuse for hot water blew out and disabled the electric in our room and two others...needless to say we were disappointed with our accommodations.

 We stayed here last week. The hotel is in a great location with lots of restaurants close by. Great location for shopping. The hotel itself is not great. I will NEVER stay here again. I was with my mom and MIL so 2 months prior to arriving I requested connecting rooms, I then reminded them 2 weeks prior to arriving and asked for early check-in. I was promised they will at least have 1 room ready, I still have it in writing. When we arrived my MIL who is not in the best health was falling asleep at the restaurant because we were told to ""go away"" and come back at 3. The rooms did not get cleaned everyday, and they are very small. We left a used napkin on the counter and it was there when we returned. There is a bad smell in the hallways and the rooms. The toilets were not cleaned properly we had to spray perfume so it has a decent smell. Our iron did not work, we asked for a replacement and 6 days later never received one. We asked for Ice and paper towel and was told they don't provide. We asked for some coffee packets and was told that they can only give us 2 packets on our first day. This was our first trip to Paris and we expected better service and based on the reviews a better hotel. One last thing, the homeless were always outside the hotel and it smells like urine all the time. A company comes out to feed the homeless every evening which is right outside the front door... I do not recommend this property.

 This hotel is very cozy and the hotel workers are very kind. This hotel is very close to the main street. If you stay here, you can go to the Arc de Triomphe by walk. It takes around 15 mimutes. And there is a big super market is located very closely to this hotel.
