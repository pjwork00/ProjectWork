Designed by the Sienese architect Baldassare Peruzzi, the harmonious Farnesina, with a central block and projecting wings, is one of the first true Renaissance villas. Peruzzi decorated some of the interiors himself, such as the Sala della Prospettiva upstairs, in which illusionistic frescoes create the impression of looking out over Rome through a marble colonnade.
The painted vault of the Sala di Galatea shows the position of the stars at the time of Chigi’s birth. After his death, the banking business collapsed, and in 1577 the villa was sold to the Farnese family.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Andrew Potts; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>6 months ago<br>Beautiful building, amazing Raphael frescoes.<br><br><b>Author: </b>A.

It was built atop the ruins of the ancient baths of Nero, next to Piazza Navona. The terrain had been acquired in the Middle Ages by the monks of the Abbey of Farfa, who later ceded it to France.

The new building was begun at the end of the 15th century and completed in 1505, for the Medici family. It housed two Medici cardinals and cousins, Giovanni and Giulio, who both later became popes as Leo X and Clement VII, respectively. Catherine de' Medici, Clement VII's niece, also lived here before she was married to Henry, son of King Francis I of France in 1533. Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, patron of the artist Caravaggio, lived there until his death in 1627.

The palace takes its name from Madama Margherita of Austria, illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V, who married another illegitimate son, Alessandro de' Medici and, after his death, Ottavio Farnese. Thus part of the art collection of the Florentine Medici family was inherited by the Farnese family.

The current façade was built in the mid-1650s by both Cigoli and Paolo Maruccelli. The latter added the ornate cornice and whimsical decorative urns on the roof.

After the extinction of the Medici in 1743, the palace was handed over to the House of Lorraine and, later, to Pope Benedict XIV, who made it the seat of the Papal Government. In 1849, Pius IX moved here the Ministries of Finances and of the Public Debt, as well as the Papal Post Offices. In 1871, after the conquest of Rome by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, the palazzo became the seat of the Senato del Regno.<br><br><b>Author: </b>union310; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>It's just like any other building in Rome, the only reason I knew it had some importance was fifty suits outside with 9mm Beretta's and the camera girl saying they were voting on something important, hmmmm the price gelato has to go up?<br><br><b>Author: </b>Karl 1974; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Palazzo Madama in Rome is the seat of the Senate of the Italian Republic.

After the settlement, in the small building that still exists today and is located to the right of the church, the University of Goldsmiths and Argentieri decided to build a church to dedicate to its patron saint (S. Eligio), for the work they paid no heed to the expense of making it designed by the great Raphael, then the realization was carried out by others, and lasted several decades.

Later, in the seventeenth century, it was rebuilt due to a collapse, always respecting the design of the Raphael.

Today the façade presents itself on two orders, on the first the original portal of the XVI century, on whose fronton there is a Latin inscription indicating that the church was built by the congregation in honor of S. Eligio.

The interior presents itself to Croce Greca, there are several 16th century frescoes.

Also of interest is the 18th century fresco on the facet of the aforementioned building, which represents the image of S. Eligio Vescovo (unfortunately it is not in a good state of conservation).

NOTE:

In Rome, many churches, since the Middle Ages, were restored and maintained by the Corporations of the arts and crafts that were called Universitas, they represented the individual activities and were also economic potentates.

Some churches had more Confraternities that ran it and in these cases it was a competition for those who made their own chapel more beautiful and sumptuous, enriching it with the symbols of their organization (A beautiful example of this is the church of Santa Maria dell'Orto ,, where there were 13 Organizations present).

Their management of the interests and needs of their members, took place precisely in these sacred places, where there were appropriate places to meet and sometimes even the speakers in them were often organized the patronal feast of their patron saint and the various religious services.

An important activity was also that of material aid for members and for any widows of the same.

After the unification of Italy, the central state abolished the confraternities by confiscating the relative assets.

However, in many churches the ancient traditions are carried out by people who want to keep this beautiful tradition alive.

To date there are still many of these churches, mainly located near the Roman Forum and then the Capitol, which was the place where decisions were made for the administration of the city and where the most important Corporations also had their own offices.<br><br>",TOUR

On this occasion, Pope Innocent III also wanted to update the name of the gate, which since then became of Santo Spirito.
The structure obviously underwent various restorations and extensions, including the probably noteworthy one by Michelangelo and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. The renewed fear of raids by Saracen pirates induced Paul III to modernize the walls that also had defensive characteristics.

Every time I try the history books, I rub my eyes to reread the events of this city.
In Piazza Nicosia, suffocated by parked cars, there is the beautiful fountain designed by Giacomo Della Porta.
Not just any one, because in Rome there are many works that bear his signature. But this one is not like the others and it was not as we see it today, because it was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, long before Valadier dedicated himself to it heart and soul with his genius.
What we see remains: the elevated octagonal basin, the elegant balustrade in cipollino marble and a basin decorated with heraldic emblems.
Only three small columns connected by two iron bars protect it from modernity.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Maria Tanasa; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>The fountain in Piazza Nicosia was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, was built in 1572 by Giacomo della Porta for Pope Gregory XIII Boncompagni, whose dragon we note on the basin, to inaugurate the restoration of the Virgin Aqueduct.
When Giuseppe Valadier carried out the current restyling of the Piazza del Popolo in 1823, it was demolished to be relocated to Piazza Nicosia in 1950, when renovation work was carried out on the area coordinated by the architect Marcello Piacentini.<br><br><b>Author: </b>vincenzo marsella; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 months ago<br>Beautiful fountain<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana del Trullo was designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1572.

Today it is located in Piazza Nicosia, it was placed here in 1950 (after having been dismantled for several years in the warehouses of the municipality).

Very beautiful is the octagonal basin, raised by two steps of the same shape, is the only original part left, the rest are reconstructions.

Fortunately it is protected by an area of ​​respect delimited by columns, connected with iron bars.

Unfortunately, the vehicles parked around and the small size of the Piazza, do not give the right emphasis to the work.<br><br>",TOUR
