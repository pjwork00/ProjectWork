A true authentic Italian restaurant where the locals eat! So reasonably priced for the quality. My only issue which I feel I have to mention is that our waiter was not too inviting as we were tourists who didn't speak Italian, he practically chucked my meal on the table and I had to catch it üòÖ. I am not marking down the place for this issue as we feel it was just him personally as everyone else was very welcoming and other waiters were friendly and joking with their tables, even those tables with tourists.

It never happened in three years that a pub does not allow me to give to my son his own food. They have good food, but definitely (or at least in my humble caring-parent opinion) not suitable as main meal for a 3 yo kid. Maybe something has changed in the last months: they refused to swap chairs to make my kid more comfortable, they do not have seats for children and they do not allow parents to give their own food to children. As a sad end of the story, while we were going away saying we cannot stay in a place where they do not allow to feed our son, they just answered ""please go away, we have other customers waiting"".

What separates good standards and snobbery is not a fine line, both are constituted by entirely different things. Artwork is too cluttered, and the bathrooms are not up to my expectations. Staff should be trained to have at least a minimal amount of knowledge about the art displayed, which they don't. Waiter didn't ask me which Amaro I would prefer and ended up serving me a 10 ‚Ç¨ J√§germeister, with that money I can buy a bottle of it in the corner store of my house, 11.000 km away from there, I would expect nothing less than a fine Italian Amaro once he didn't ask. And also looked annoyed when I asked if it was more typical in Italy drinking it with or without ice. Regrettable seeing a caf√© which has been open since 1760 like this.

O que separa os bons padr√µes da pretens√£o n√£o √© uma linha t√™nue, os duas s√£o constitu√≠dos de coisas completamente diferentes. A arte fica amontoada nas paredes e os banheiros n√£o se enquadram com o esperado. O servi√ßo deveria ser treinado para ter o m√≠nimo de conhecimento sobre a arte disposta, o qual eles n√£o tem. O gar√ßom n√£o perguntou qual Amaro eu gostaria e me serviu uma J√§germeister de 10 ‚Ç¨, com esse pre√ßo eu consigo comprar uma garrafa na esquina da minha casa, 11 mil km de dist√¢ncia de l√°, por esse pre√ßo eu esperava um amaro italiano de primeira qualidade.

I really don't even want to give Roscioli a rating... because I'm afraid it's already been discovered and I don't want to not be able to get a table next time I come to Rome (or let's get real, tomorrow when I go back for dinner again).

They are known for the cabonara, which is creamy perfection, but I cannot hold back my praises for the world's creamiest burrata and most mouth watering pasta: the cacio e pepe (which is four cheese & four peppers).  Oh my god.

The wine is great, the meats and cheeses are obviously fabulous (it's literally a stone cellar restaurant in the back of a butcher shop), but Jesus is that cacio e pepe pasta good.<br> NEXT <br> <br>"

Everything was delicious, only the waiter paid us absolutely no attention.  Even when he brought a snack, he did not bring us plates, we were forced to take turns eating from one plate, since it was impossible to eat without a plate.  In the end we asked for the bill, for which we waited at least half an hour. We paid 200 euros in one piece of paper.  Two days later, when we paid with change from those 200‚Ç¨ (he gave for us three papers of 50‚Ç¨, 150‚Ç¨ in total), the cashier in the food store told us that 50‚Ç¨ was fake.  It was for sure change from this restaurant because I have only 200‚Ç¨ for my trip and don‚Äôt have another money.  we went to the police and spent a few hours there instead of walking around the city.  Always check the change in this restaurant.

I remember I normally paid ‚Ç¨15 or so for a buffet but today it was ‚Ç¨25/ person. It‚Äôs actually not ‚Ç¨25 food. I wanted to leave when I realised that the buffet wasn‚Äôt served like how it was but I longed to eat here for 3 weeks üò©

Anyway, after we came home, my husband got sick sick- not sure what it was...maybe the soup as I only had a bite of that while he had 2 bowls.

This is the picture of my ‚Ç¨25 meal...for 2 people it was ‚Ç¨50...sorry but this is our last visit üòû
There was a table of 3 left because they found the price was unrealistic. I don‚Äôt blame them.

Barman can't speak English very well,had trouble understanding each other<br> NEXT <br> <br>Author: Adrian Tudor; Rating: 3; When: a year ago <br> We arrived at an early evening hour when the place was not too busy.
Service was good from the beginning although not very helpful with dish choices (we were approached each time by a different waiter).
Wine by the glass was good but expensive.
Throughout the meal we noticed some of the dishes lacked the taste described in the menu.
The artichoke lacked personality and there was not even a hint of mint. The soup was excellent.
The spaghetti carbonara was a complete disappointment. The pasta and the meat were excellently done yet the sauce was overly salted and acidic.
The seared pig was excellent and perhaps the best dish we had.
We asked for one desert and got a combination of three without an explanation.
The atmosphere was pleasant throughout our stay.
All in all it seems that this joint tries to be many things in the same place - bar and breakfast downstairs, fine dining upstairs.

So I tried a couple of standard Italian fare items that weren't marked as frozen: caprese salad & tiramisu.  The mozzarella had clearly also been frozen and was rubbery.  Sent this back & they still charged me for it.  The tiramisu wasn't horrible but there was way too much espresso powder (maybe...it had no real taste) on top that made it difficult to eat.

Had a Grolsch beer on tap which was the best part of the meal.

The advertised ""live"" music was non-existent and there was no-one inside on a Friday night at 8:30pm.

He also walked away from me before i could give him my drink order. We waited around 30-45 minutes for our main course, which meant that we were not offered a dessert menu as it appeared the kitchen was closed. We were ignored for another half hour while we waited to order a cocktail, even though there were only 4 tables of people, including us, and three wait staff.

My wife being a Coeliac and unable to tolerate gluten was immediately reassured that the menu had a number of available options for her.

We sat outside under the canvas umbrella's that have built in air conditioning vaporisers that spritz you with moisture every couple of minutes, very cool and it doesn't disturb your meal. After a magnificant tiramasu we decided to return for dinner the next evening. Sitting inside the restaurant we entered a 21st century elegant yet modern Italian restaurant with the decor consisting of creams and blacks, striking paintings and great lighting. The service was second to none with every need attended to. The menu offers great choice with a great price compariable with what you get out on the main Piazza, its a steal. We had the antipasti for two to start and were delighted when 6 dishes consisting of meats, salads, cheeses and some veg options came out. We decided to skip the pasta course and moved straight to meat and fish, the seabass and the steak were beautiful and such a treat. Our evening ended with a complimentary glass of limoncello and with a promise to the owner that we'd return during our next visit to Rome.

We chose this hotel due to the close proximity to our apartment rental, and was extremely impressed in all the offerings. The staff are very nice, extremely helpful, they accommodated our very short notice (ie.: walk in booking).

The hotel has character, it has a mix of historical vintage posh flair with modern amenities. The rooms are so bright and the ceilings very tall, and the decor matches to make the place look full of character.

The garden is beautiful in the centre, plus the bar and restaurant is amazing. This is as central as you can get to shopping (including high end shops) and a myriad of restaurants within a very short walking distance, including a small supermarket.

They even blasted the music in the empty central courtyard (which all the rooms look out on to and acts as an amplifier). Apparently they play Christmas music until the Epiphany (6th Jan).
