    "feedback1": "I LOVE the idea of following the steps of my favorite books. Please make this happen!! The page needs to be more user friendly. Make it funnier, focus on the graphics and give priority to the info.",
    "feedback2": "It's amazing to discover by yourself the places you read in your favourite books, it makes them real!! It's original and easy to use; it's great to have some suggestion about hotels and restaurants: it simplifies your trip!!",
    "feedback3": "As a person who loves books and movies, I found myself many times looking up for this information but it can get confusing. Having a website/app that allows you to directly plan a trip based on this, and in such a complete way (even proposing hotels, restaurants, etc), sounds amazing to me!"
