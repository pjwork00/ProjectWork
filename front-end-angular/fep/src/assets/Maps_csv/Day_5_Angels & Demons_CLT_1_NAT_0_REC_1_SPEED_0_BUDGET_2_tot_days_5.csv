Lots of places to sit and lounge around. Bartenders were very nice and their English was fine. Great for groups to sit around a table to have a drink or seven.

The place is great. I threw a gathering for 17 people for my 19th bday and it was so nice. Totally recommend!!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Michal Glinka; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>We arrived around 7pm for some good cocktails, but there was no other guests at the time. The bar was completely empty. The service was very good. The style of the bar is probably dated to the 90/00's looking on the interieur.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Wesam Rukun; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>An ok food.
