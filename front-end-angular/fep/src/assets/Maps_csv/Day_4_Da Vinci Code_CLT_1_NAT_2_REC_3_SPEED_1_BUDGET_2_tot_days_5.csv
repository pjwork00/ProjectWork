It’s so happy to live in Paris, as long as you have time, you can come and see it anytime. It’s very helpful for human beings. It’s very helpful for children. Born in Paris, you can come here every day when you have time.  In addition to food and wine, Chen Hao also has culture, art and healthy Paris.

Display, atmosphere, the building, object are amazing. there is a locker room for free and it is so convenient to leave bags and walk around. taking picture was forbidden for many saloons. yet the memory of it good enough.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Fabio De Angelis; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>2 months ago<br>Who am I to evaluate such a wonderful, astonishing museum, full of masterpieces of world culture? If you are in Paris, take your time to spend three, four hours, one day in this must-to-be-seen museum! Enjoy that time! ;)<br><br><b>Author: </b>Marcos Chavarria; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>2 months ago<br>Great museum, great location. You could think it is a small museum, but the distribution and the amount of art pieces you will find are endless. You can spend 3 hrs here easily. I recommend it for youngs and adults. I would go back definitively.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Jessica Zug; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>Beautiful museum if you're mainly interested in impressionism, expressionism and everything around and between that!

Even though there aren't green leafy trees because of the season, it's still amazing to walk around and enjoy the scenery and marvel at all the buildings around the park. You can enjoy seeing family and tourists gathered and just enjoying the same space as you and make you just want to enjoy the moment even longer. It's a nice area to go for a run with the ground mostly heavy sand and not very rocky.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Luca Doria; <br><b>Rating: </b>2<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>Impressive in the historical context and beautiful architecture that surrounds it but the swathes of grit and very little green make them quite soulless as many other gardens in central Paris. The great space occupied by grit and sand in hot days make you feel almost like you are in a desert. With impending climate change there should be more grass, bushes and somewhat a turn towards an English landscaped garden...it would be much better. I hope that Paris local authorities are gonna adapt these Gardens as overall they're not welcoming places.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Elena; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>very beautiful! you can walk around, sit on one of the cute green chairs and watch. one of the water fountains, or relax in a nice café! beautiful roman statues you can see everywhere! sadly the floor is full of sand/dust and because it's a little windy the dust gets everywhere on your clothes and shoes...<br><br><b>Author: </b>Solyi H; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>7 months ago<br>What a beautiful place.  The flower garden was exceptionally well designed taken cared of.  It’s lovely to go when there are very few people around.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Abigail Cai; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>7 months ago<br>It’s my favorite vibe in Paris. I spent time sitting on the chair with my friends under the shade of the tree. There are always beautiful flowers there and the Ferris wheel.<br><br>",,,,3
