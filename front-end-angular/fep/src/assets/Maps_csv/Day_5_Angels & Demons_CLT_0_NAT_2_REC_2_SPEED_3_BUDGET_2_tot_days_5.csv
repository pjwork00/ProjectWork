Designed by the Sienese architect Baldassare Peruzzi, the harmonious Farnesina, with a central block and projecting wings, is one of the first true Renaissance villas. Peruzzi decorated some of the interiors himself, such as the Sala della Prospettiva upstairs, in which illusionistic frescoes create the impression of looking out over Rome through a marble colonnade.
The painted vault of the Sala di Galatea shows the position of the stars at the time of Chigi’s birth. After his death, the banking business collapsed, and in 1577 the villa was sold to the Farnese family.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Andrew Potts; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>6 months ago<br>Beautiful building, amazing Raphael frescoes.<br><br><b>Author: </b>A.

History:

The fountain was built in a later period, but always in the 16th century and is attributed to Nanni di Baccio Bigio, who did some restoration work on the palace.

Description of the work:

The non-functioning fountain (mute) is quite graceful inside a niche, decorated with a valve there is a Putto embracing the tails of two dolphins in the shape of volutes under him, who have their mouths open, from which a time the water poured out on a pan.

Two niches frame the niche, adorned with bas-reliefs depicting masks and which have human figures as capitals which are surmounted by a broken lintel above which has two stars on the sides with eight points on the sides, probably heraldic symbols.

NOTE on the conservation status of the work:

It is not in good condition and a restoration activity is required that would require the integration of the deficiencies and a cleaning of the incrustations.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Paolo Emilio Capaldi; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 years ago<br>Pretty fountain in Via Giulia, leaning against the left corner of Palazzo Sacchetti, corner via the mullet.
Made in the second half of the fifteenth century, perhaps by Sangallo the Younger.
At the center is a child supported by two dolphins and below, was a pan to collect water.
The frame shows two women and two faces of masks.
At the center, above the Putto, there is a shell; close the top frame the stars, the Chigi family crest.<br><br>",,,4,
