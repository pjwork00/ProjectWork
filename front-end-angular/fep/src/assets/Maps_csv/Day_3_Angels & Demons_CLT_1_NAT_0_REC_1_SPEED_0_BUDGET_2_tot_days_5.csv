We didn't eat anything, just had drinks. Drinks were fine, but it's more of a bar for beer and sports.

The architecture is different from other landmarks as it was intended for a different purpose in the religious history. Prepare to walk a lot.

Even though I did not go in (entrance fee = 15EU), I still loved the outside area and the little park next to it. When you go inside, it is recommended to go before sunrise, as the sunrise view on top of the terrace should be lovely.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Ken Saberi; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>7 months ago<br>Great place to visit with spectacular views all around Rome. Interesting artefacts and some Papal history to see. Some of the rooms are stunning. There are a lot of stairs so people with mobility issues may struggle although there is a lift to the second level which can be used on request. This does mean that you will lose out on the top terrace which provides the best views. All the staff were extremely helpful and kind.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Rich; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>A fine visit.
