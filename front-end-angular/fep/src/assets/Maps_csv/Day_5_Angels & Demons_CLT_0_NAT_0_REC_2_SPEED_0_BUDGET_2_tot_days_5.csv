We didn't eat anything, just had drinks. Drinks were fine, but it's more of a bar for beer and sports. It satisfied though since we were stopping every so often to grab a drink and snack before we moved on to the next place.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Steve Lipp; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>Nice, cosmopolitan place with local and international brews and drinks.

Thanks.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Pei-Hsuen Liao; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Gorgeous bar, with phenomenal drinks and the nicest staff. Having experienced speakeasy style bars in New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo, I would put Emerald's up against the best. Not only were the drinks stellar, the staff was beyond nice. On a crowded night with no seats available, they noticed one person in my party had a mobility issue and immediately found a spare seat for him. Such hospitality and talent made for a truly wonderful night.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Jacquie Orphanopoulos; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>5 months ago<br>Very cozy, nice atmosphere....cool people!!
