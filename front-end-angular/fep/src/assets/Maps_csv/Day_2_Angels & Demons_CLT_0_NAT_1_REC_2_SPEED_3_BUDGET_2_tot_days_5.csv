is a Roman Catholic church in Rome, not far from Piazza Navona. The church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to St. Denis the Areopagite and St. Louis IX, king of France. The church was designed by Giacomo della Porta and built by Domenico Fontana between 1518 and 1589, and completed through the personal intervention of Catherine de' Medici, who donated to it some property in the area. It is the national church in Rome of France.<br><br><b>Author: </b>George; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>The ceiling is covered in beautiful art.

Designed by the Sienese architect Baldassare Peruzzi, the harmonious Farnesina, with a central block and projecting wings, is one of the first true Renaissance villas. Peruzzi decorated some of the interiors himself, such as the Sala della Prospettiva upstairs, in which illusionistic frescoes create the impression of looking out over Rome through a marble colonnade.
The painted vault of the Sala di Galatea shows the position of the stars at the time of Chigi’s birth.

Things started off slow, we registered to sing, got a little card and took some seats next to the wall.

The karaoke system is old school, and most of the songs are in italian--but there is a nice list of American songs as well.

We all toss the mic around from person to person, sing together, create makeshift duets. It was a magical experience, I felt like I was back in my old choir group.

The amount of joy in the atmosphere was amazing. I really felt like part of this little inclusive group of singers.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Suzana Caneca; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>Best karaoke in Rome!

If you ask for a song expect someone else to sing it....
as they don’t call who asked for the song.
