My favorite one is the Calling of St. Matthew on the left-side wall of the chapel (which is the darker side of the wall, unfortunately).

Short explain:
is a Roman Catholic church in Rome, not far from Piazza Navona. The church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to St. Denis the Areopagite and St. Louis IX, king of France. The church was designed by Giacomo della Porta and built by Domenico Fontana between 1518 and 1589, and completed through the personal intervention of Catherine de' Medici, who donated to it some property in the area. It is the national church in Rome of France.<br><br><b>Author: </b>George; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>The ceiling is covered in beautiful art.

Designed by the Sienese architect Baldassare Peruzzi, the harmonious Farnesina, with a central block and projecting wings, is one of the first true Renaissance villas. Peruzzi decorated some of the interiors himself, such as the Sala della Prospettiva upstairs, in which illusionistic frescoes create the impression of looking out over Rome through a marble colonnade.
The painted vault of the Sala di Galatea shows the position of the stars at the time of Chigi’s birth. After his death, the banking business collapsed, and in 1577 the villa was sold to the Farnese family.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Andrew Potts; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>6 months ago<br>Beautiful building, amazing Raphael frescoes.<br><br><b>Author: </b>A.
