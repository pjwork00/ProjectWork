The museum was founded in the Fascist era with the aim of documenting the local history and traditions of the ""old Rome"" that was rapidly disappearing, but following many donations and acquisitions of works of art is now principally an art museum. The collections initially included 120 water-colours by the nineteenth-century painter Ettore Roesler Franz of Roma sparita, ""vanished Rome"", later moved to the Museo di Roma in Trastevere.<br><br>",,,,0

Designed by the Sienese architect Baldassare Peruzzi, the harmonious Farnesina, with a central block and projecting wings, is one of the first true Renaissance villas. Peruzzi decorated some of the interiors himself, such as the Sala della Prospettiva upstairs, in which illusionistic frescoes create the impression of looking out over Rome through a marble colonnade.
The painted vault of the Sala di Galatea shows the position of the stars at the time of Chigi‚Äôs birth. After his death, the banking business collapsed, and in 1577 the villa was sold to the Farnese family.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Andrew Potts; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>6 months ago<br>Beautiful building, amazing Raphael frescoes.<br><br><b>Author: </b>A.
