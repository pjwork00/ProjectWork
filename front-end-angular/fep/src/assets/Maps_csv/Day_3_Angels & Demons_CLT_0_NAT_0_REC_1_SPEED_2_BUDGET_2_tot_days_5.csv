Short explain:
is a¬†Roman Catholic¬†church in¬†Rome, not far from¬†Piazza Navona. The church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to¬†St. Denis the Areopagite¬†and¬†St. Louis IX, king of France. The church was designed by¬†Giacomo della Porta¬†and built by¬†Domenico Fontana¬†between 1518 and 1589, and completed through the personal intervention of¬†Catherine de' Medici, who donated to it some property in the area. It is the¬†national church in Rome¬†of¬†France.<br><br><b>Author: </b>George; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>The ceiling is covered in beautiful art.
