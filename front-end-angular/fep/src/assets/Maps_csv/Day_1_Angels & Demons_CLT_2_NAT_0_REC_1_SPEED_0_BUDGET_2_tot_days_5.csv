The architecture is different from other landmarks as it was intended for a different purpose in the religious history. Prepare to walk a lot. I would recommend the walking tour if possible.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Marcel van Poeijer; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 months ago<br>This huge Castle is definitely worth a visit. Even though I did not go in (entrance fee = 15EU), I still loved the outside area and the little park next to it. When you go inside, it is recommended to go before sunrise, as the sunrise view on top of the terrace should be lovely.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Ken Saberi; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>7 months ago<br>Great place to visit with spectacular views all around Rome. Interesting artefacts and some Papal history to see. Some of the rooms are stunning. There are a lot of stairs so people with mobility issues may struggle although there is a lift to the second level which can be used on request. This does mean that you will lose out on the top terrace which provides the best views. All the staff were extremely helpful and kind.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Rich; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>A fine visit.

We went late afternoon without a line stopping us to enter the museum quickly. By entrance you get a map of the museum with pictures of the objects on it. With a little scanner, headphone included, you can tab on the picture what is relevant at the moment you stand in front of an object. You will here a voice in your selected language explaining the background of the piece. Several mechanical creations can be tried. By doing this you get close in the genius mind of Leonardo Da Vinci and realize he went far in front of his era. Also for kids this is a very educative museum wich stimulates the mind. After the tour in the museum you can buy fun souvenirs like T-shirts, books, etc.<br><br>",,,,0
