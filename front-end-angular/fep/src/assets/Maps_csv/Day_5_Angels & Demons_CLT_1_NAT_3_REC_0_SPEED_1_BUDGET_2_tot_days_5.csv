Really like this park because it is very beautiful,huge, well kept and it also have different view points.

A bit tricky to find a car park if you are coming with car.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Naz Shirani; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>Lovely park in Rome. So many beautiful turtles!

Avoid Viva Bistro, it was awful!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Khalid Sohail; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a month ago<br>Very nice, big park. Its excellent for running, cycling and even for picnics. There is a lake inside the park which is very beautiful. There is also a cafe Vivi that is very good.<br><br><b>Author: </b>MaryYa; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>3 months ago<br>Nice place for a wolk or sports activities. Plenty of space, high trees, lakes with adorable ducks. There is a villa house and green labyrinth on a territory but no access into it. Also searching for a parking place might be a struggle.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Pauline Marie Calimlim; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>Huge park with such beautiful surprises! Great for walks and exercise. It also has a children's playground and many benches to seat on.<br><br>",,,,4

there are many beautiful gardens in Rome that are better taken cared and more pleasant to spend time in... the only worthwhile place was a bench in bamboo section with a nice view (actually bamboo section was the only decent part)

I was impressed by the massive ancient platanus next to the eleven fountains steps. And i liked also the tropical greenhouse but i fear they should find a way to increase its roof not enough high. Fens valley looked a bit messy. The Samples garden can be risky so pay attention to bees.<br><br>",,,,4
