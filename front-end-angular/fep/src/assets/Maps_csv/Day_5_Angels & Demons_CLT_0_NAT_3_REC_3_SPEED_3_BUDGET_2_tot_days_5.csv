A truly beautiful fountain built in the second half of the eighteenth century, positioned in a niche between two pillars and kept in a more than decent way, is definitely worth a visit.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>The fountain is located in a niche obtained from a pillar placed between two arches that join the Churches of San Rocco and San Girolamo degli Schiavoni, and was built in 1774, as indicated in the inscription above it, probably with the contribution of the Confraternity of the Osti and Barcaroli.

Before it was located near the Mausoleum of Augustus and for the works related to its isolation and the creation of Piazza Augusto Imperatore, it was dismantled and reassembled where we can now admire it.

The rectangular niche is surrounded by white marble, the fountain has, inside a shell, the head of a boy, with the cap of a porter, from whose mouth comes the water that spills onto a small semicircular basin, placed at top of the rocks,

This water in turn, through two spouts placed at the base of the tray, comes out on a rectangular basin supported by a barrel.

NOTE
Also at Largo San Rocco, a few meters from the fountain, there is another element that is worth seeing is a hydrometer, which as indicated in the inscription was inserted in 1821.

It served to measure the level of the Tiber floods, and by observing it better, one can see the inscriptions indicating the height reached by them in the sixteenth century: they are incredibly high.

FOUNTAINS NOTE IN ROME

The fountains in Rome, are one of the characteristic elements of the eternal city, there are those who say that it is the city with the most fountains in the world.
They have been an important element since ancient Rome, today in addition to the typical cast-iron fountains called ""nasoni"" (around 2000), there are some very beautiful ones located in the most different places, such as villas, squares, streets, courtyards and more.

Some have been created by the greatest artistic geniuses of all times, a name above all Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

The importance they have in street furniture is also demonstrated by the admiring looks of tourists and by the fact that they also have the social utility of quenching thirst after perhaps a long walk in the sun.<br><br><b>Author: </b>M.
