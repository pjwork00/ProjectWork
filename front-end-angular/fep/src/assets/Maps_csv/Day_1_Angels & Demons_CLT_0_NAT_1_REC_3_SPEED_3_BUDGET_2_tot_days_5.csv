Interesting artefacts and some Papal history to see. Some of the rooms are stunning. There are a lot of stairs so people with mobility issues may struggle although there is a lift to the second level which can be used on request. This does mean that you will lose out on the top terrace which provides the best views.

When I came here about two years ago, there were people dressed as Roman soldiers with whom tourists eagerly took pictures (I did too!).

It has everything you need, clearly marked walkways, cobble stones and even statues.

Credible grapefruits show us how goldfishes can be snails. An eager chicken is a grape of the mind! A powerful melon without bees is truly a chicken of boundless melons.

After a long day at school and work, they were lost without the pro-active giraffe that composed their peach.

Designed by the Sienese architect Baldassare Peruzzi, the harmonious Farnesina, with a central block and projecting wings, is one of the first true Renaissance villas. Peruzzi decorated some of the interiors himself, such as the Sala della Prospettiva upstairs, in which illusionistic frescoes create the impression of looking out over Rome through a marble colonnade.
The painted vault of the Sala di Galatea shows the position of the stars at the time of Chigi‚Äôs birth. After his death, the banking business collapsed, and in 1577 the villa was sold to the Farnese family.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Andrew Potts; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>6 months ago<br>Beautiful building, amazing Raphael frescoes.<br><br><b>Author: </b>A.
