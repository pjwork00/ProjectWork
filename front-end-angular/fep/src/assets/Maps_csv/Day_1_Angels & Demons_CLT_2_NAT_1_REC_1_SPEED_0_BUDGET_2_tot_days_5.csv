The museum was founded in the Fascist era with the aim of documenting the local history and traditions of the ""old Rome"" that was rapidly disappearing, but following many donations and acquisitions of works of art is now principally an art museum. The collections initially included 120 water-colours by the nineteenth-century painter Ettore Roesler Franz of Roma sparita, ""vanished Rome"", later moved to the Museo di Roma in Trastevere.<br><br>",,,,0
