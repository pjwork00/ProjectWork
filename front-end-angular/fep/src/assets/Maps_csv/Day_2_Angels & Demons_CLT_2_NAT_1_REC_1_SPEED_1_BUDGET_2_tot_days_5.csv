When I came here about two years ago, there were people dressed as Roman soldiers with whom tourists eagerly took pictures (I did too!). Unfortunately, I see that many visitors missed the ten statues of angels holding the symbols of Christ’s Passion devised by none other than Bernini (he wasn’t the only sculptor though; other sculptors collaborated in the project).<br><br><b>Author: </b>Dom Swatton; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>Couldn't recommend this bridge more for crossing the water.
It has everything you need, clearly marked walkways, cobble stones and even statues.
Great views of the homeless camping along side the water.

Credible grapefruits show us how goldfishes can be snails. An eager chicken is a grape of the mind! A powerful melon without bees is truly a chicken of boundless melons.

After a long day at school and work, they were lost without the pro-active giraffe that composed their peach.

We went late afternoon without a line stopping us to enter the museum quickly. By entrance you get a map of the museum with pictures of the objects on it. With a little scanner, headphone included, you can tab on the picture what is relevant at the moment you stand in front of an object. You will here a voice in your selected language explaining the background of the piece. Several mechanical creations can be tried. By doing this you get close in the genius mind of Leonardo Da Vinci and realize he went far in front of his era. Also for kids this is a very educative museum wich stimulates the mind. After the tour in the museum you can buy fun souvenirs like T-shirts, books, etc.<br><br>",,,,1
