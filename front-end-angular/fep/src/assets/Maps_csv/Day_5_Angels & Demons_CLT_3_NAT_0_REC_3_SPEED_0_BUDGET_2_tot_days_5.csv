Having experienced speakeasy style bars in New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo, I would put Emerald's up against the best. Not only were the drinks stellar, the staff was beyond nice. On a crowded night with no seats available, they noticed one person in my party had a mobility issue and immediately found a spare seat for him.

Flavio, the owner, does everything with me (and I am sure with everyone) to put me at ease and always does his utmost to find a space, even a small one, to solve my 'aesthetic' problems.
In short, an indispensable Barber Shop point.<br><br>",,,,4

We went late afternoon without a line stopping us to enter the museum quickly. By entrance you get a map of the museum with pictures of the objects on it. With a little scanner, headphone included, you can tab on the picture what is relevant at the moment you stand in front of an object. You will here a voice in your selected language explaining the background of the piece. Several mechanical creations can be tried. By doing this you get close in the genius mind of Leonardo Da Vinci and realize he went far in front of his era. Also for kids this is a very educative museum wich stimulates the mind. After the tour in the museum you can buy fun souvenirs like T-shirts, books, etc.<br><br>",,,,4
