Designed by the Sienese architect Baldassare Peruzzi, the harmonious Farnesina, with a central block and projecting wings, is one of the first true Renaissance villas. Peruzzi decorated some of the interiors himself, such as the Sala della Prospettiva upstairs, in which illusionistic frescoes create the impression of looking out over Rome through a marble colonnade.
The painted vault of the Sala di Galatea shows the position of the stars at the time of Chigi‚Äôs birth.

It was built atop the ruins of the ancient baths of Nero, next to Piazza Navona. The terrain had been acquired in the Middle Ages by the monks of the Abbey of Farfa, who later ceded it to France.

The new building was begun at the end of the 15th century and completed in 1505, for the Medici family. It housed two Medici cardinals and cousins, Giovanni and Giulio, who both later became popes as Leo X and Clement VII, respectively. Catherine de' Medici, Clement VII's niece, also lived here before she was married to Henry, son of King Francis I of France in 1533. Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, patron of the artist Caravaggio, lived there until his death in 1627.

The palace takes its name from Madama Margherita of Austria, illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V, who married another illegitimate son, Alessandro de' Medici and, after his death, Ottavio Farnese. Thus part of the art collection of the Florentine Medici family was inherited by the Farnese family.

The current fa√ßade was built in the mid-1650s by both Cigoli and Paolo Maruccelli. The latter added the ornate cornice and whimsical decorative urns on the roof.

After the extinction of the Medici in 1743, the palace was handed over to the House of Lorraine and, later, to Pope Benedict XIV, who made it the seat of the Papal Government. In 1849, Pius IX moved here the Ministries of Finances and of the Public Debt, as well as the Papal Post Offices. In 1871, after the conquest of Rome by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, the palazzo became the seat of the Senato del Regno.<br><br><b>Author: </b>union310; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>It's just like any other building in Rome, the only reason I knew it had some importance was fifty suits outside with 9mm Beretta's and the camera girl saying they were voting on something important, hmmmm the price gelato has to go up?<br><br><b>Author: </b>Karl 1974; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Palazzo Madama in Rome is the seat of the Senate of the Italian Republic.

Every time I try the history books, I rub my eyes to reread the events of this city.
In Piazza Nicosia, suffocated by parked cars, there is the beautiful fountain designed by Giacomo Della Porta.
Not just any one, because in Rome there are many works that bear his signature. But this one is not like the others and it was not as we see it today, because it was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, long before Valadier dedicated himself to it heart and soul with his genius.
What we see remains: the elevated octagonal basin, the elegant balustrade in cipollino marble and a basin decorated with heraldic emblems.
Only three small columns connected by two iron bars protect it from modernity.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Maria Tanasa; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>The fountain in Piazza Nicosia was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, was built in 1572 by Giacomo della Porta for Pope Gregory XIII Boncompagni, whose dragon we note on the basin, to inaugurate the restoration of the Virgin Aqueduct.
When Giuseppe Valadier carried out the current restyling of the Piazza del Popolo in 1823, it was demolished to be relocated to Piazza Nicosia in 1950, when renovation work was carried out on the area coordinated by the architect Marcello Piacentini.<br><br><b>Author: </b>vincenzo marsella; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 months ago<br>Beautiful fountain<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana del Trullo was designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1572.

Today it is located in Piazza Nicosia, it was placed here in 1950 (after having been dismantled for several years in the warehouses of the municipality).

Very beautiful is the octagonal basin, raised by two steps of the same shape, is the only original part left, the rest are reconstructions.

Fortunately it is protected by an area of ‚Äã‚Äãrespect delimited by columns, connected with iron bars.

Unfortunately, the vehicles parked around and the small size of the Piazza, do not give the right emphasis to the work.<br><br>",,,3,

I would have paid to watch the spectacle of the carriages, wagons and carts passing through the old narrow streets without pavement of vanished Rome.
As their number increased dramatically, many of the fountains the city had equipped itself with, which reduced the carriageway, began to create problems.
Moving them for traffic reasons was a widespread practice and via della Scrofa follows exactly the layout of an ancient Roman road and the fountain of the same name has not escaped the rule.
But the memory of it remains in a bas-relief left in its original position, along the facade of the building that was the convent of the Augustinians.
While not far away, right at the corner with via dei Portoghesi, there is now the small hanging tub with the superimposition of a simple cinnamon, from which a jet of fresh water comes out.
It is protected by three small columns connected to each other by two iron bars.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana della Scrofa (located in the street of the same name) is located in the VIII Eustachio district, once it was in the position, where today there is a bas-relief depicting a sow.

In the fifteenth century the bas-relief was walled up and at the end of the sixteenth century it was transformed into a fountain with the addition of a small basin.

In 1874 with Rome became the capital of Italy, the traffic in the area increased dramatically and therefore was a hindrance, so the bas-relief remained at its original point, while the fountain itself was moved a short distance to the corner of the street with Via dei Pellegrini .

The above is indicated in an inscription placed below the bas-relief:

IN THIS PLACE
IT WAS PLACED
FOUNTAIN
MOVED TO THE CORNER OF THE VIA DEI PORTOGHESI
IN THE YEAR 1874

The fountain then placed at the aforementioned corner is made up of a small nozzle, from which the water that flows onto the cup-shaped basin comes out, from which in turn the water arrives in a collection basin on the ground.

Three columns connected by bars that serve as an area of ‚Äã‚Äãprotection are placed as protection.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Alessandro Romanella; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>3 years ago<br>The ""real"" fountain of the Scrofa existed in the same street that takes its name, and was built in 1580 at the behest of Pope Gregory XIII.
