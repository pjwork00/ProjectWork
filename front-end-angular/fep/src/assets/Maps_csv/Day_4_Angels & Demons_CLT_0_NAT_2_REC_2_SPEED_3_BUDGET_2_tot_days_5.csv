Having experienced speakeasy style bars in New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo, I would put Emerald's up against the best. Not only were the drinks stellar, the staff was beyond nice. On a crowded night with no seats available, they noticed one person in my party had a mobility issue and immediately found a spare seat for him.

Flavio, the owner, does everything with me (and I am sure with everyone) to put me at ease and always does his utmost to find a space, even a small one, to solve my 'aesthetic' problems.
