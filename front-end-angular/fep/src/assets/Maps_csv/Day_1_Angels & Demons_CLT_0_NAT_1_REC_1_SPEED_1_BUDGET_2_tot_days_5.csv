When I came here about two years ago, there were people dressed as Roman soldiers with whom tourists eagerly took pictures (I did too!). Unfortunately, I see that many visitors missed the ten statues of angels holding the symbols of Christ’s Passion devised by none other than Bernini (he wasn’t the only sculptor though; other sculptors collaborated in the project).<br><br><b>Author: </b>Dom Swatton; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>Couldn't recommend this bridge more for crossing the water.
It has everything you need, clearly marked walkways, cobble stones and even statues.
