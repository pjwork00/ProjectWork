Every time I try the history books, I rub my eyes to reread the events of this city.
In Piazza Nicosia, suffocated by parked cars, there is the beautiful fountain designed by Giacomo Della Porta.
Not just any one, because in Rome there are many works that bear his signature. But this one is not like the others and it was not as we see it today, because it was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, long before Valadier dedicated himself to it heart and soul with his genius.
What we see remains: the elevated octagonal basin, the elegant balustrade in cipollino marble and a basin decorated with heraldic emblems.
Only three small columns connected by two iron bars protect it from modernity.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Maria Tanasa; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>The fountain in Piazza Nicosia was originally located in Piazza del Popolo, was built in 1572 by Giacomo della Porta for Pope Gregory XIII Boncompagni, whose dragon we note on the basin, to inaugurate the restoration of the Virgin Aqueduct.
When Giuseppe Valadier carried out the current restyling of the Piazza del Popolo in 1823, it was demolished to be relocated to Piazza Nicosia in 1950, when renovation work was carried out on the area coordinated by the architect Marcello Piacentini.<br><br><b>Author: </b>vincenzo marsella; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>4 months ago<br>Beautiful fountain<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>3<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana del Trullo was designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1572.

Very beautiful is the octagonal basin, raised by two steps of the same shape, is the only original part left, the rest are reconstructions.

Fortunately it is protected by an area of ‚Äã‚Äãrespect delimited by columns, connected with iron bars.

Unfortunately, the vehicles parked around and the small size of the Piazza, do not give the right emphasis to the work.<br><br>",,,3,

I would have paid to watch the spectacle of the carriages, wagons and carts passing through the old narrow streets without pavement of vanished Rome.
As their number increased dramatically, many of the fountains the city had equipped itself with, which reduced the carriageway, began to create problems.
Moving them for traffic reasons was a widespread practice and via della Scrofa follows exactly the layout of an ancient Roman road and the fountain of the same name has not escaped the rule.
But the memory of it remains in a bas-relief left in its original position, along the facade of the building that was the convent of the Augustinians.
While not far away, right at the corner with via dei Portoghesi, there is now the small hanging tub with the superimposition of a simple cinnamon, from which a jet of fresh water comes out.
It is protected by three small columns connected to each other by two iron bars.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Stefano Manzo; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>2 years ago<br>The Fontana della Scrofa (located in the street of the same name) is located in the VIII Eustachio district, once it was in the position, where today there is a bas-relief depicting a sow.

In the fifteenth century the bas-relief was walled up and at the end of the sixteenth century it was transformed into a fountain with the addition of a small basin.

In 1874 with Rome became the capital of Italy, the traffic in the area increased dramatically and therefore was a hindrance, so the bas-relief remained at its original point, while the fountain itself was moved a short distance to the corner of the street with Via dei Pellegrini .

The above is indicated in an inscription placed below the bas-relief:

IN THIS PLACE
IT WAS PLACED
FOUNTAIN
MOVED TO THE CORNER OF THE VIA DEI PORTOGHESI
IN THE YEAR 1874

The fountain then placed at the aforementioned corner is made up of a small nozzle, from which the water that flows onto the cup-shaped basin comes out, from which in turn the water arrives in a collection basin on the ground.

History:

The Fontanella is one of those created by Publio Morbiducci, winner of a competition promoted by the Governorate of Rome, in 1928, for the replacement of some cast iron fountains, with others of greater decoration.

It was made entirely of travertine, a stone that is the symbol of the city of Rome.

It was inaugurated on October 28, 1929.

Description of the Work:

The fountain is placed on a small rectangular porphyry rise, bordered by travertine which also determines an area of ‚Äã‚Äãrespect, has a particular predominantly triangular configuration, which rests on two cylinders placed at the sides, in the lower part and is surmounted by a hemisphere with four wedges

In the center there is an oval medallion, surmounted by a cardinal's hat and a cross and two bas-reliefs inside, the upper one representing a griffin symbol of the Parione district, in which there is the fountain and in the lower part a flower-shaped tile , in the center of which there is a curved cinnamon from which the water flows out and pours into a small rectangular basin, with the features of a small Roman sarcophagus, where on the front side on a scroll is the inscription SPQR

NOTE on the state of conservation of the work:

It is discreet even if it requires the removal of limestone encrustations and in my opinion a larger area of ‚Äã‚Äãrespect should be created, perhaps with columns joined by iron bars, to prevent the parking of cars or scooters less than one meter away.

NOTE FOUNTAINS IN ROME

The fountains in Rome are one of the characteristic elements of the Eternal City, some say it is the city with the most fountains in the world.

They have been an important element since ancient Rome, today in addition to the typical cast iron fountains called ""nasoni"" (around 2000), there are very beautiful ones located in the most diverse places, such as villas, squares, streets, courtyards and more.

Some were made by the greatest artistic geniuses of all time, one name above all Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

The importance they have in street furniture is also evidenced by the admiring glances of tourists and by the fact that they also have the social utility of quenching thirst after perhaps a long walk in the sun.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Mario D; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>3 years ago<br>Not very large rectangular fountain, it looks like a drinking trough for horses.
