Recommended!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Roberto Rupcich; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great time watching live Jazz with some very talented musicians! Above what I was expecting. The show is in a smaller room upstairs where they cram quite a bit of people. Fortunately, they don’t let people smoke up there. Chairs are not very comfortable. Drinks are good and prices are 10-14€ per drink. Go before the live shows and happy hour downstairs is fun with cheaper drinks. Server was very friendly although a little slow since he was the only one upstairs attending to the live music room.
My wife and I had a great experience here but it was certainly due to the music. Go check it out! They seems to hire very talented artists!

They are treated like factory animals and abused in the most despicable way by the manager and owner of this club.
Avoid this place like you would avoid any toxic waste.

We were not informed on check in that there would be construction in the lobby the week we were there, this seems pertinent as our room was above the lobby. I was told the noise would only be for one day, however each day we were there, there was construction. I was told each day by the front of house that it was the last day and that the next day it would be quiet. Additionally directly next door they were doing construction, and the manager tried to blame it on them saying the noise was coming from across the street, even though we could feel the floor shaking. They offered to move us to a different room, but each day I was told the noise would stop so I decided against the inconvenience. I had to ARGUE with the manager Alexi and was RUDELY INTERRUPTED multiple times. They claim to be a four star hotel but are closer to a airport motel. Terrible customer service.
