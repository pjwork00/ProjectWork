Two month went pass he never answered my phone and at the end I managed to speak to him after he sent me an email saying that The insurance company at 99% will not be able to refund anything since there was not any break-in sign to the safe.

Maybe this is due to a preference of a soft but a bit firm mattress that I have but I can not sleep because it feels as if I am laying on rocks. I woke up after a few 3 hrs of sleep now again in the middle of the night with back pain and aches in my neck. I’ve used the pillows as a topper.

We received a room upgrade upon arrival, which was a nice gesture. If possible get a room with balcony as you can see the Dome from there. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the room was spacious and well-equipped as compared to other Rome hotels we have visited.  The hotel's staff was courteous and welcoming (apart for some of the waitresses at the restaurant, who were not very attentive - e.g. they would not ask if you need anything like espresso). The hotel is in a very convenient and quiet location. One thing that could be improved is the breakfast - while the variety was satisfactory, it was one and the same each morning. The New Year's buffet dinner was a bit of a disappointment - the mood was not particularly festive and it closed before the start of the new year. Food was also a bit on the bland side.<br><br>"

I almost want to rate it 5 stars, but it was not perfect.  First, the service staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  In this hotel, the elevator is extremely small, a common hotel feature throughout Europe, so I got worried because my family brought a lot of luggage.  Yet, I think the staff is aware of this, so they offer to bring your luggage to your room, which created a good, initial impression on me.  In addition to the staff, I  liked the room my family got.  The room was very clean and modern-looking; furthermore, it also came with a nice, spacious patio!  After seeing my room, I still could not believe I was in a best western hotel.  The only reason why I can't give this hotel 5 stars is the room tends to get hot very easily.  The room has AC, but it is very weak.  Besides a few problems, I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Rome!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Sandy Kelver; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>We stayed 4 nights at this Best Western Plus hotel in Rome.  All the staff are friendly, helpful and make you feel welcomed from the minute you walk in the front door.  Rooms are a good size and very clean.  Bedding and towels are a nice quality.  The hotel is located within a 5 minute walk from the subway station and Vatican museum.  The bar and restaurant, located inside the hotel, offers a small menu but the variety of food offered is likely to appeal to most everyone.  The food is yummy!  If we were to return to Rome we would definitely stay here.<br><br>"

This hotel has a magical leg up on all others - the view! Yes, you will pay more for it but WOW. It is special to come home after touring Rome and sit atop a roof gazing at St Peters Basilica and looking over the city. We did this every night and every morning ❤️
The staff! Amazing, nice, well spoken and support needs and requests in a timely manner (speak many languages!)
Cleanliness!(with one exception see below)
Breakfast - full breakfast that included Italian favorites (cornetti yum!) and traditional American (bacon and eggs yum!)
Drinks! Delicious
Coffee - hot and ready!

What wasn’t so great:
We chose this hotel during the pandemic for its convenient location to the Vatican and its restaurant and bar. We were disappointed that both evening occasions in the roof top bar our waiter (same both evenings) was not accommodating and somewhat rude. On our last night we asked to sit on top and they said it was closed, and seated us on the lower level, then a half hour later we saw service occurring upstairs - why pay for a supreme view of as a guest you can’t access it during “open” hours? We settled for the Lower level, still nice views and then at 10:55 we asked for one more drink - people had bottles of wine on ice still so we figured good to go. We were told by the waiter “ no the bar is closed” he then walked upstairs to the roof top area weren’t allowed to drink at. We continued to wait for our bill only to see the bartender make another full tray of drinks and coffee. What??!?! We were stung a bit but shrugged it off. Just felt wrong.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Lessley Ann; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>We took advantage of fabulous postcorona offer. And for the price we got more than expected.

They left our bags in the main lobby for several hours unattended even though we were promised they would put them in our room (we checked in early but as the room wasn't ready, we left our bags and returned in the evening several hours later).

We were attacked by a thief inside the hotel in the morning while going for breakfast. He walked in freely to 3rd floor, and jumped on us in a narrow corridor, hitting me in the face and pushing down the stairs. Thankfully other guests came with help and he run away.
The hotel didn’t care. The reception was empty once I went down (nobody checks who enters the hotel). Finally the receptionist appeared and said he didn’t see anything (well, not surprisingly) and that’s a normal thing. They didn’t even bother to check if the thief left the hotel or to notify the police. I left my number for a manager who didn’t bother to call me. I never felt such disregard for guests even in 1-star hotels. Unless this hotel
cooperate with thiefs which would explain their approach.

However there was a lot of small annoying things that you would not expect in a 5 star hotel.
Electricity was out for an hour in our room because the rooms fuse blew while we were getting ready and the seemingly overworked girl at the reception did not really care much... the electrician was very apologetic while we were standing there in the dark in our underwear. The employee smoking corner is right next to the gym which then smelled badly of smoke. Late check out was a huge deal to get 30min more until 1:30 and the guy promptly did not tell his colleagues who then called us rather persistently to get us out of the room. My birthday was also completely ignored.... so why bother make me fill in your form with that information. And lastly when we asked for a possibility to upgrade to a room not facing the alley we were offered only crazy expensive options of200€ more per night while on their website the difference to a room with a view would have been only a fraction of that.
All in all not a great performance and mostly unnecessary. Did it ruin the stay? No... but if you want to be a five star hotel you are measured by different standards... and the GranMelia Rome failed.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Benoit Hanssen; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>5 months ago<br>Beautiful / elegant hotel. Great location. Matrasses are a bit hard.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Alexey Miroshnichenko; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>My partner and I were robbed at Villa Agrippina on the 22 of August, 2020. My wallet containing two passports, credit cards, cash and SIM cards was stolen right from the room safe. The manager on duty was not helpful at assisting us in figuring out what had happened. He refused to review the tapes and show us the door log citing privacy issue. The manager accompanied us to the police station to write a report. Upon arrival from the police station we had turned the room upside down together with the manager and a housekeeper - nothing was found. We spent a couple of hours in the lobby discussing the details with the consulate over the phone about getting our passports reissued. Upon return to the room we discovered that the stolen wallet was placed back into the safe.
We ran downstairs to reception to confront the manager, he approached us and brazenly said “Oh I heard you found it” like nothing had happened. The manager denied having any involvement in the theft of my wallet.
We quickly packed our belongings, paid the bill and left the hotel as we no longer felt safe staying at the property.
What we assumed had happened is whoever took the wallet had returned it while we were downstairs with the manager trying to figure out the situation with the consulate and our further hotel reservations.
Till this day we have not received any news of the investigation, the hotel general manager has reached out to us but nothing has been resolved.
Avoid this hotel!!!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Yvon Ne; <br><b>Rating: </b>1<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>The only good thing about this hotel is the outdoor pool which made me choose this hotel. When Rome gets hot it’s great to have a place where you can refresh in the afternoon. That said at the Gran Melia you also have to be prepared to share this pool with a loud and drunk crowd that plays music and screams around, so it’s not the most relaxing place. Unfortunately also the staff is not very caring. For example in my room the power went out and even after an hour I sat in the dark. The staff didn’t ask if there was any progress or just offered an other room. It’s just that, the staff doesn’t care here, a five star hotel shouldn’t leave that feeling in the end. You can just go somewhere else except a pool is the thing you want.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Alina Simeonova; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>9 months ago<br>NIce hotel in the center of Rome. it is close to multiple locations .

Don't book it, unless they confirm you in writing you get a room on the upper floors (4 5 6). Remaining floors are below the average and not worth the price they ask for.
There are many other nice hotels in the area and I will try them, before giving another chance to this one.

This is apartment hotel with fridge, kitchen, dishwasher etc.

There is a mini mart opposite and a bigger supermarket ( Coop) with very reasonable prices 2 blocks away. We got great Italian wines for 3euros there. The quality of Breakfast could be improved given the room price ( and I was happy that I had the option to fry the eggs downstairs rather than eat up) And we had the best cleaning person for our room - very very perceptive to what our needs were.

Fantastic location in the middle of Rome and  in quite place.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Clark Renney - Actor; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>10 months ago<br>My Wife and I stayed here last October and cannot praise them enough. This is an absolutely outstanding hotel within walking distance of most of Rome's major places of interest. It has a romantic rooftop restaurant with exquisite food and views through 360° of the Eternal City. My Wife is disabled and yet this was never a problem for us in our seven night stay, and staff consistently went out of their way to make our time in Rome memorable. The hotel has wonderful decoration and furnishings which are conducive to peaceful work or leisure. The internet connection was a little sporadic in our room and the television only has three or four channels broadcasting in English which is surprising given the number of British and American guests we encountered. However this in no way detracted from our experience.
Above all, as in every case, the crucial factor was the personnel, who were simply outstanding. Everyone from the Concierge to the restaurant staff to those who cleaned our room were a credit to their profession.
We would not hesitate to stay here again...<br><br><b>Author: </b>Michael Wright; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Very clean, friendly, the staff was very helpful on telling us where do to go especially because we only had 2 days in town. The first night we were tired and didn't want to go out and we didn't have reservations for dinner and they were very accommodating and got us a table. It was nice to wake up in the morning and open your windows and look down a quite road!!<br><br>"

Plan on visiting again<br><br><b>Author: </b>Tricia Verzosa; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>The lady at the bar on the night of February 10 has a warm smile. Helped us feel at ease and comfortable after a long flight from LAX. Two gentlemen at the desk were also accommodating, appear to be always eager to help. Another lady at the breakfast buffet also had a warm smile. She made sure our coffee cup was refilled as much as we want. I like that choices for the breakfast buffet included warm food, cold meat, lots of dairy, juices and a variety of breads. We get to receive a copy of the daily gospel, slid under our door before 3 AM; my mom thinks this is thoughtful. My mom is 70, gets tired easily, and she was thankful that the hotel is just steps away from the St. Peter's Square. Being a Catholic, and considering our trip a pilgrimage,  the proximity of the hotel to the Vatican definitely made our trip memorable.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Mary Wilmot; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>We stayed for several nights in last year. The location was wonderful and gave us the opportunity to get up early and go straight to St Peter’s for morning mass each day when it opened. It’s a little far from the Centro, but definitely an easy, fun walk to get to the Pantheon, etc. (maybe 20-30 min). Not far from the metro either. The breakfast was really good, but evening drinks on the terrace made it all worth it! Definitely would stay here again.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Oz Mezer; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>We stayed for 2 nights a family of 3. We got a good price for the hotel. The hotel is located adjacent to the Vatican so 20 seconds you are in the St. Peter Square…
The hotel has a big balcony that looks over to the Vatican. They have also a bar/restaurant that is located in the balcony.
The hotel is nice and clean. Our room was big as it was for three persons. Everything worked well in the room.
The breakfast was good with good variety of dishes.
Wifi worked well.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Mary Neubaum; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Across the street from the Vatican
Small room and King bed. Tiny shower stalls.  Wonderful breakfast. Great view from the restaurant. They have a supper with fund raisers nightly. Fantastic view. Small portions. Liquor. MN<br><br>"

We booked one room with twin beds for two nights, but our shower was broken. We didn't even notice ourselves, but when we arrived were immediately offered two separate rooms with full functionality and a free breakfast for the two days after as compensation. The second night we could stay in the room we booked, because they had fixed the shower. The staff was very pleasant and helpful about everything and were the best feature of the hotel. The location of the hotel is nice too: only ten minutes needed to reach the Vatican and a bus will take you anywhere within 30 minutes, so we had almost no travel issues due to time. The issues we did have were because of the giro d'italia which was in Rome while we were, but we didn't know this prior to our stay and we weren't told about it either. A great hotel for a reasonable price, I would surely recommend a stay here.<br><br>"
