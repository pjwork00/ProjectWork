Very nice & helpful folks all around this amazing hotel. Great rooms in a great neighborhood to stroll around in. At Christmas, there's a small x-mas market next door, and it's near a million shops.

From the lounge, you can see the only entrance/exit from the children's playroom, so if you want to grab an espresso or something stronger, you can keep an eye on your kids (6yoa & 7 yoa at the time of this writing). If you do stop by the bar, ask for Fares (Ferris), a very understanding bartender who doesn't bat an eyelash when you run to the playroom to see who's crying!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Anastasiya Maykut; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>I came to Paris for my 20th birthday.

First of all: Kindness!
Here I found the best receptionist ever: Djamel! He‚Äôs very kind and he will help you to find everything you‚Äôre looking for spend a great holiday! He will do the best he can to be sure you have all you need! So if you are staying in this hotel, ask for him!
Second: this hotel is located right in the city centre so in few minutes by walk you have the opportunity to visit the most famous attractions! If you prefer use the public transport, the underground station in right in front of the entrance of the hotel!
Third: the hotel is clean and you can also enjoy a great and continental breakfast, full of delicious croissants and waffles and cheese!

Ci sono molte ragioni per cui amo questo hotel!
Prima di tutto: gentilezza!
Qui ho trovato il receptionist migliore in assoluto: Djamel! Lui √® molto gentile e ti aiuter√† a trovare tutto ci√≤ che stai cercando per trascorrere la tua vacanza nel migliore dei modi! Lui far√† tutto ci√≤ che pu√≤ per assicurarsi che tu stia comodo e abbia ci√≤ di cui hai bisogno. Quindi... se decidete di stare qui, chiedete di Djamel!
Secondo: l‚Äôhotel √® situato nel centro della citt√† e in pochi minuti si ha la possibilit√† di   Raggiungere (a piedi o in metro) le attrazioni pi√π famose. (La stazione della metro √® proprio davanti all‚Äôentrata dell‚Äôhotel).
Per concludere: la colazione e la pulizia dell‚Äôhotel sono eccezionali.

The staff would apologize and wouldn‚Äôt do anything to solve the main problem.

It‚Äôs frustrating to go up and down to find out that I can‚Äôt get into the room.

The room service left my room door open after cleaning it our second day. The heat would barely work and I would come back to my room finding the window wide open.

It‚Äôs 40 degrees out. I stayed here 6 days and I checked out leaving sick.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Jaime Plath; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>4 months ago<br>We spent two nights at the Westin Vendome for our New Years trip to Paris.  We were beyond excited to be in the city of love! Upon arrival at the Westin we were told the room wasn‚Äôt ready although we were there at the scheduled check in time of 3pm.

The front desk staff did everything they could do to find us a room that was cleaned and ready but as Titanium Elite members we had already been upgraded to the largest room in our room category they had available.  We were obviously ready to hit the ground running and get out into the city but we were requested to wait until our room was ready.  However that time was undetermined so we were given a courtesy drink at the bar for each of us. While they held our luggage we made our way to the bar where we were delightfully surprised at the ambiance and friendly staff.  Plus the drinks were delicious!  We thought it was an amazing start to our few days in Paris as we sat enjoying our cocktails and snacks. After an hour our room was still not ready and the staff comped another round of drinks for us. Although it was frustrating not to be able to get in and clean up after arriving from the long trip and embarking on the city but we really enjoyed the relaxed start to the weekend and were thankful for the time at the bar.
Once we got checked into our room we were able to get to the streets of Paris!  We made it back to our room later that night to find a bottle of champagne and chocolate provided on the house!    We were recently engaged and couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased at the service the Westin was providing. Excellent touch!  The following evening we were upgraded to a suite which exceeded out expectation! It was HUGE!  We had two balconies which gave us a view of the Tuileries garden.  We thoroughly enjoyed the extra space especially the sitting room area.  Lastly of note was the breakfast, which was comprised of a full buffet including everything from pastries & coffees to made to order eggs.  We enjoyed this every morning as a perfect start to our day.  We would highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Paris - great location, excellent amenities & incredible staff.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Alex Everything; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>my stay was great. the staff are helpful and the rooms are well furnished.i have used this hotel for all my Paris trips. it has a great continental breakfast with everything from sushi to omelets.  so if I could I would rate it not 1 not 2 not the not four not five but six stars.

6th time back to St. James & Albany. Over past 20 years it's been refurbished quit a bit. Mostly good smart changes. One of the few hotels with a grand piano available, although currently lacking a bench. I've heard guests playing Chopin & Rachmaninov pretty well here. Fairly good breakfasts, good bar after 4 PM. On warm days try meals in their courtyard. Very clean, but still showing signs of wear and age. Rooms on courtyards are very quiet.

My family and I have been traveling all day from Chicago. We knew that check-in is at 3pm so we decided to just check our bags since we arrived at noon. The front desk told us that our room wouldn‚Äôt be ready until 3 but there are smaller rooms available now. We said we‚Äôll wait for the bigger room that we have booked. (Why would we stay at a smaller room when we paid for the big room???) We left to explore and returned at 2 to nap in the lobby since we have been awake for 24 hours.

Right at 3pm, one of the ladies informs us that our room wouldn‚Äôt be ready for an additional 45-60 mins. A smaller room was available, but she suggested to just wait since our original room is much bigger. It‚Äôs 4:15 and they haven‚Äôt checked in on us so I asked what was going on. I stated my valid complaints and this other lady was so unapologetic and unaccommodating. She couldn‚Äôt care less that we weren‚Äôt being taken cared for. She said the room was going to take another 30 mins... I kept asking why and they accused us that it was because we wanted a bigger room.

No. You guys are wrong. We just wanted the room we booked. We have been awake for 24 hours adjusting from Chicago to Paris time, so all we want to do is sleep in our room that was suppose to be ready at 3pm. We never asked for a change or upgrade. Stop blaming your customers for your incompetence. The room wasn‚Äôt ready when they should have been - this is your responsibility. What‚Äôs the point of having a check-in when the rooms aren‚Äôt ready? They literally said ‚Äújust because we have a check in doesn‚Äôt mean the rooms are ready‚Äù - OK, so I guess customers can just check out whenever because they‚Äôre not ‚Äúready‚Äù right at check-out.

I had to raise my voice at them in front of other visitors lecturing how this was wrong and unacceptable and they did not apologize. We demanded to speak to their manager and after a few minutes the lady comes back and said that our room was ready. (Wow, how convenient. How long were you guys keeping that room from us?) The manager didn‚Äôt even come out to apologize. We left the lobby and entered our room very angry. What a great welcoming by the entire staff.

I‚Äôm not sure why this hotel has over 4 stars when their customer service is a joke and the staff is so unwelcoming. Is this how you treat all customers or just Asians? We are Korean-Americans and it felt as though we were being discriminated because they were friendly towards all the Caucasians. We were lied to about our room‚Äôs availability multiple times, the staff blamed us for their mistakes, they didn‚Äôt apologize or offer any discounts to make up for their poor hospitality.

Later that day, they slipped an apology letter with a box of chocolate. They addressed us as mister... We‚Äôre all females! They can‚Äôt even apologize correctly or in person. Here‚Äôs an advice: get the suffix right and apologize to our face to make it personal.

To Citadines Saint-Germain-Des-Pres, do better. Much better.

*Be advised:
Housekeeping is only once a week and if you need additional stuff like toilet paper and towels, they charge you extra! The hallways smells like rotten eggs and therefore they have to use harsh chemicals to mask the smell.*<br><br><b>Author: </b>Caryl Lamothe; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Great location!

It's very beautiful,  and centrally located... and they have delicious chocolate cake that room service can bring.Who cares if it was featured in The Bourne Identity. Matt Damon isn't here. The floors in our room were stained with something dark and mysterious.  The refrigerator didn't work and smelled like human organs were stored in there at one point. The scratched-up clothing iron looked as if it had been stolen from a pauper's estate sale. Two words for the bathroom crew: grout cleaner. The lock on the door was insufficient, the room overlooked a gravel deck of nothingness... but you could walk right over to the Louvre in about 5 minutes. And that's pretty snappy, and well worth  your sheckels.<br><br><b>Author: </b>S Rod; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>It was our girls trip and we visited the restaurant/bar. The bartender Raquel was the best host. She was friendly attentive even though she was busy. We noticed other employees not doing much or helping her. Raquel did work very hard to serve all and the drinks where excellent. I recommend staying at the Regina Hotel it‚Äôs a great location and definitely stop by the bar and see  Raquel she will make you the best cocktail in town.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Charles Glover; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>A grand old hotel with just the most fantastic location. I‚Äôve stayed there twice. Ask for a room with a view of the Tuileries and the Eiffel Tower and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. The hotel has a lot of prestige and history, but I found the experience a bit of a letdown in comparison to other hotels in Paris, even those in the Bavarez chain. Considering the cost I didn‚Äôt feel like I got very good value for money at all. That said, I did have one of the best meals of my life in the restaurant.<br><br>"

Little things count a lot in a hotel room: the bed was super comfortable, the electric outlets were in convenient places, the shower worked well , and the magnified mirror was much appreciated.  The breakfast was very good--everything you could want was served.  Most impressive of all was the staff.  Every person was so nice, friendly and helpful.

Breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful and pleasant. Icing on the cake is that the hotel wes located at the most convenient location! Everything that I wanted to visit was either walking distance and if I needed to hop on the metro, it was really close, too. Will not hesitate to stay there again!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Marek B; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>The hotel is very well located in downtown Paris, close to many key attractions and shopping locations. The room we had was very spacious and comfortable. The staff were very helpful.  I actually have only one remark and this is why I'm not rating 10 - at some point during our stay,  few guys moved into the room adjutant to ours. They were coming back in the middle of the night being very noisy (the walls are not exactly soundproof). The hotel staff was unable to deal with it. They were speaking with them but there was no result. When I discussed this situation with the staff in the morning I was told that they can't guarantee that next evening will be quite as they spoke to the other guests but they might not listen.  Honestly, I'd expect more concrete action from the hotel of this rating and price.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Dude; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>In A Nutshell:

-Hotel Edouard 7 is in a great location.
-You'll be nearby most of the main tourist attractions (walking distance to the Louvre, Tuileres Park, etc...)
-The staff are very friendly & informative (great recommendations on French hip hop artists & where the locals go to hang).
-There's a small bar located near the front desk along w/ some additional seating in the back & a private meeting room.
-The room was normal French size (small), but very clean & unique details w/ a balcony that you can go outside.
-Uber drivers can pick-up/drop-off very easily.

Overall, this is a good hotel to stay at if you want to be central to many tourist attractions.<br><br>"

We were there for business, and it suited us very well as our meeting locations were very nearby.

Staff were very pleasant and helpful, even for requests like change for the vending machine.

Small negative points:
- Shower was very tiny, I am UK size 14/French size 42 and 175cm tall, the door squashed me when opening and closing, and I could not bend down to pick items up in the shower. So if you are bigger than that, be careful!
- Not very soundproof, we could hear other people easily. But I did not have trouble sleeping.
- No plug socket by the bed, only at the desk. Bring an extension cable if you like to work on the laptop in bed, or want to have the phone close by when sleeping.

Big plus points!:
- Comfortable beds and soft pillows
- Delicious continental breakfast also with hot scrambled eggs and some meats.
- Very clean, bathroom triple plus clean
- Helpful and nice staff
- Best location possible
- Vending machine in lobby is good for snacks and drinks.

In total it was a good experience and I recommend to our company to put us here again. Also recommend to people coming for city break as you are right near the Louvre and many shopping places.<br><br><b>Author: </b>T Squirrel; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>The rooms and bathrooms has been renovated since the last time I've been there.
