Never had espresso so creamy and smooth. Not a hint of burn/bitter taste like the ones we get in North America. Pastries were good too. I went there every day while I was in Rome for a week. I love the novelty of being able to stand by the bar and seeing the pros at work and listening to the clicking of cups, hissing of the espresso machines. Sitting is over-rated.

We saw this place had good reviews and a good menu so we decided to come here on Saturday night. We were shown to a table by a very polite and friendly waiter after being forgotten by the first waiter (the one who served us for the duration), yet were then rudely told we couldn’t sit at that table by who appeared to be the head waiter. Instead we were stuck down in the corner, while the original table remained empty. Our waiter was quite abrupt; he forgot my order, asked me again but still managed to bring the wrong starter. He also walked away from me before i could give him my drink order. We waited around 30-45 minutes for our main course, which meant that we were not offered a dessert menu as it appeared the kitchen was closed. We were ignored for another half hour while we waited to order a cocktail, even though there were only 4 tables of people, including us, and three wait staff. The food was great but you would expect better service for somewhere on the pricier end. Very disappointed with the waiter and the head waiters attitude towards us. Seemed as though we were treated poorly because we’re young and tourists. We’re all paying customers at the end of the day.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Lou Mustillo; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>8 months ago<br>Excellent food and service.

Thanks must go to the wonderful waiter who made us so welcome on our initial request for a table. he was and is the epitome of what you would hope for when entering a restaurant. Welcoming ,kind and appreciative of our custom. Thank you for making our day in Rome and our lunch at cybo  so memorable.

My wife being a Coeliac and unable to tolerate gluten was immediately reassured that the menu had a number of available options for her. We shared a gluten free pizza and carbonara with truffel and it was fabulous. The coffee was perfect and the cheerful banter from other members of the team made for an excellent lunch.

You consider yourself fortunate when you come across a gem like cybo and today we felt particularly blessed. Wha a difference kindness and a smile makes to a dining experience. Particularly when the menu options available match the welcome.

Thank you to all at cybo for making our time in Rome even more speciAl than we could have hoped for.<br><br>"

I searched ""pub"" and Highlander Pub came up.

The entrance is unassuming, so you might miss it if you're not looking. It's downstairs and has 2 rooms, a bar and a dining area. The bartender was this woman from Argentina who was a riot, and the conversation didn't feel forced or awkward at any point. The beer prices are average for Rome. Everyone here speaks perfect English.

I would recommend this for anyone in the area looking for a true, sit-down bar experience. Also, definitely recommended for fellow beer lovers.<br><br>"

Residenza di Ripetta is no exception. A bit oldish, a bit outdated... The effort they put in keeping it good, it would need a complete renovation... At least new paint on the walls and new furniture... In the rooms and in the common areas.
The people are very nice, they really try their best. A great thanks to all the people.

While sitting there we asked the waitor for some snacks, maybe a couple of cheeses or something - to go with the wine. It was not on the menu but he said he could make something for us. We were super clear that we were not looking for something to eat, that we had already ate and just wanted a small snack with the wine. He ended up serving us a four different types of cheese, including a big mozzarella and then charging us €30 for it. The wine was €7/glass which was totally fine. This place really screwed us over. Don't go there!<br><br><b>Author: </b>Michael Asheroff; <br><b>Rating: </b>4<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Really good food at rational pricing.

Great wine selection.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Vorname Nachname; <br><b>Rating: </b>2<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>The food is good, not great. The prices are okay.
My glass was broken at the bottom and on the wine bottle the date was blacked out for whatever reason, nevermind.

There are a lot of friendly waiters, the one who served my table however was very unfriendly. An old guy with white hair, near bold head.
At one point he brought my dish and shouted ""Eh!"" to place directly on my serviette, close to pushing away my hands with the plate.
The other dishes he served wordlessly and in a harsh manner.
Sorry for coming to your restaurant, old man!
This place shouldn't be listed in the Guide Michelin, the food doesn't make up for things like this.<br><br><b>Author: </b>Clive Field; <br><b>Rating: </b>5<br><b>When: </b>a year ago<br>Stunning food!

The downsides were that the bed was quite firm, the bathroom was quite small and the door to the room was a bit of a hassle to open.
